<HD SOURCE="HED">Explanation</HD>

<P>The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and 
permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments 
and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which 
represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into 
chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is 
further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</P>

<P>Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and 
issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:</P>


<IPAR>

<P SOURCE="P1">Title 1 through Title 16 </P>

<STUB>as of January 1</STUB>

<P SOURCE="P1">Title 17 through Title 27 </P>

<STUB>as of April 1</STUB>

<P SOURCE="P1">Title 28 through Title 41 </P>

<STUB>as of July 1</STUB>

<P SOURCE="P1">Title 42 through Title 50 </P>

<STUB>as of October 1</STUB>

</IPAR>

<P>The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.</P>


<SIDEHED>

<HD SOURCE="HED">LEGAL STATUS</HD>

<P>The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed 
(44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the 
text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).</P>

</SIDEHED>


<SIDEHED>

<HD SOURCE="HED">HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</HD>

<P>The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues 
of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to 
determine the latest version of any given rule.</P>

<P>To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date 
(in this case, October 1, 2016), consult the “List of CFR Sections Affected 
(LSA),” which is issued monthly, and the “Cumulative List of Parts Affected,” 
which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These 
two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment 
of any given rule.</P>

</SIDEHED>


<SIDEHED>

<HD SOURCE="HED">EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</HD>

<P>Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register 
since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the 
regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal 
Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are 
usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the 
actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the 
cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future 
effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal 
Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be 
inserted following the text.</P>

</SIDEHED>


<SIDEHED>

<HD SOURCE="HED">OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</HD>


<P>
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies 
to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. 
<PRTPAGE P="vi"/>
Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments 
to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as 
possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
</P>

</SIDEHED>


<SIDEHED>

<HD SOURCE="HED">PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</HD>

<P>Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the 
revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may 
find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the 
appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the 
reader, a “List of CFR Sections Affected” is published at the end of each CFR 
volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the 
volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code 
prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published 
for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.</P>

</SIDEHED>


<SIDEHED>

<HD SOURCE="HED">“[RESERVED]” TERMINOLOGY</HD>

<P>The term “[Reserved]” is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal 
Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a “[Reserved]” location 
at any time. Occasionally “[Reserved]” is used editorially to indicate that a 
portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a 
printing or computer error.</P>

</SIDEHED>


<SIDEHED>

<HD SOURCE="HED">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</HD>


<P>

<E T="03">What is incorporation by reference?</E>
Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal 
agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register 
by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to 
be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect 
of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were 
published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like 
any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.
</P>


<P>

<E T="03">What is a proper incorporation by reference?</E>
The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference 
only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on 
which approval is based are:
</P>

<P>(a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material 
published in the Federal Register.</P>

<P>(b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to 
afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</P>

<P>(c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in 
accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</P>


<P>

<E T="03">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found?</E>
If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an 
approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the 
regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you 
find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal 
Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, 
College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.

A subpoena is a document that may require you to attend a proceeding, produce 
documents or other physical evidence in your possession or control, or both. 
PHMSA may issue a subpoena either on its initiative or at the request of someone 
participating in a proceeding. Anyone who requests that PHMSA issue a subpoena 
must show that the subpoena seeks information that will materially advance the 
proceeding.

receive money to cover attendance and mileage expenses. The attendance and 
mileage fees will be the same as those paid to a witness in a proceeding in the 
district courts of the United States.
</P>

<P>(2) If PHMSA issues a subpoena to you based upon a request, the requester 
must serve a copy of the original subpoena on you, as required in § 105.50. The 
requester must also include attendance and mileage fees with the subpoena unless 
the requester asks PHMSA to pay the attendance and mileage fees because of 
demonstrated financial hardship and PHMSA agrees to do so.</P>

<P>(3) If PHMSA issues a subpoena at the request of an officer or agency of the 
Federal government, the officer or agency is not required to include attendance 
and mileage fees when serving the subpoena. The officer or agency must pay the

<SUBJECT>Serving a subpoena.</SUBJECT>


<P>
(a) 
<E T="03">Personal service.</E>
Anyone who is not an interested party and who is at least 18 years of age may 
serve you with a subpoena and fees by handing the subpoena and fees to you, by 
leaving them at your office with the individual in charge, or by leaving them at 
your house with someone who lives there and is capable of making sure that you 
receive them. If PHMSA issues a subpoena to an entity, rather than an 
individual, personal service is made by delivering the subpoena and fees to the 
entity's registered agent for service of process or to any officer, director or 
agent in charge of any of the entity's offices.
</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Service by mail.</E>
You may be served with a copy of a subpoena and fees by certified or registered 
mail at your last known address. Service of a subpoena and fees may also be made 
by registered or certified mail to your agent for service of process or any of 
your representatives at that person's last known address.
</P>


<P>
(c) 
<E T="03">Other methods.</E>
You may be served with a copy of a subpoena by any method where you receive 
actual notice of the subpoena and receive the fees before leaving the hearing at 
which you testify.
</P>


<P>
(d) 
<E T="03">Filing after service.</E>
After service is complete, the individual who served a copy of a subpoena and 
fees must file the original subpoena and a certificate of service with the PHMSA 
official who is responsible for conducting the hearing.
</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 105.55</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Refusal to obey a subpoena.</SUBJECT>


<P>
(a) 
<E T="03">Quashing or modifying a subpoena.</E>
If you receive a subpoena, you can ask PHMSA to overturn (“quash”) or modify the 
subpoena within 10 days after the subpoena is served on you. Your request must 
briefly explain the reasons you are asking for the subpoena to be quashed or 
modified. PHMSA may then do the following:
</P>

<P>(1) Deny your request.</P>


<P>
(2) Quash or modify the subpoena.
<PRTPAGE P="13"/>

</P>

<P>(3) Grant your request on the condition that you satisfy certain specified 
requirements.</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Failure to obey.</E>
If you disobey a subpoena, PHMSA may ask the Attorney General to seek help from 
the United States District Court for the appropriate District to compel you, 
after notice, to appear before PHMSA and give testimony, produce subpoenaed 
documents or physical evidence, or both.

<SUBJECT>Process for issuing rules.</SUBJECT>


<P>
(a) PHMSA (“we”) uses informal rulemaking procedures under the Administrative 
Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) to add, amend, or delete regulations. To propose or 
adopt changes to a regulation, PHMSA may issue one or more of the following 
documents. We publish the following rulemaking documents in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register</E>
unless we name and personally serve a copy of a rule on every person subject to 
it:
</P>

<P>(1) An advance notice of proposed rulemaking.</P>

<P>(2) A notice of proposed rulemaking.</P>

<P>(3) A final rule.</P>

<P>(4) An interim final rule.</P>

<P>(5) A direct final rule.</P>

<P>(b) Each of the rulemaking documents in paragraph (a) of this section 
generally contains the following information:</P>

<P>(1) The topic involved in the rulemaking document.</P>

<P>(2) PHMSA's legal authority for issuing the rulemaking document.</P>

<P>(3) How interested persons may participate in the rulemaking proceeding (for 
example, by filing written comments or making oral presentations).</P>

<P>(4) Whom to call if you have questions about the rulemaking document.</P>

<P>(5) The date, time, and place of any public meetings being held to discuss 
the rulemaking document.</P>

<P>(6) The docket number and regulation identifier number (RIN) for the 
rulemaking proceeding.</P>

<SECTNO>§ 106.15</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Advance notice of proposed rulemaking.</SUBJECT>

<P>An advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) tells the public that PHMSA 
is considering an area for rulemaking and requests written comments on the 
appropriate scope of the rulemaking or on specific topics. An advance notice of 
proposed rulemaking may or may not include the text of potential changes to a 
regulation.</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 106.20</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Notice of proposed rulemaking.</SUBJECT>

<P>A notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) contains PHMSA's specific proposed 
regulatory changes for public comment and contains supporting information. It 
generally includes proposed regulatory text.</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 106.25</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Revising regulations without first issuing an ANPRM or NPRM.</SUBJECT>

<P>PHMSA may add, amend, or delete regulations without first issuing an ANPRM or 
NPRM in the following situations:</P>

<P>(a) We may go directly to a final rule or interim final rule if, for good 
cause, we find that a notice of proposed rulemaking is impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. We must place that finding and 
a brief statement of the reasons for it in the final rule or interim final 
rule.</P>

<P>(b) We may issue a direct final rule (see § 106.40).</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 106.30</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Final rule.</SUBJECT>

<P>A final rule sets out new regulatory requirements and their effective date. A 
final rule will also identify issues raised by commenters in response to the 
notice of proposed rulemaking and give the agency's response.</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 106.35</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Interim final rule.</SUBJECT>

<P>An interim final rule is issued without first issuing a notice of proposed 
rulemaking and accepting public comments and sets out new regulatory 
requirements and their effective date. PHMSA may issue an interim final rule if 
it finds, for good cause, that notice and public procedure are impracticable, 
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. PHMSA will clearly set out this 
finding in the interim final rule. After receiving and reviewing public 
comments, as well as any other relevant documents, PHMSA may revise the interim 
final rule and then issue a final rule.</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 106.40</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Direct final rule.</SUBJECT>


<P>
A direct final rule makes regulatory changes and states that the regulatory 
changes will take effect on a specified date unless PHMSA receives an adverse 
comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment within the comment 
period—generally 60 days after the direct final rule is published in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

</P>


<P>
(a) 
<E T="03">Actions taken by direct final rule.</E>
We may use direct final rulemaking procedures to issue rules that do any of the 
following:
</P>

<P>(1) Make minor substantive changes to regulations.</P>

<P>(2) Incorporate by reference the latest edition of technical or industry 
standards.</P>

<P>(3) Extend compliance dates.</P>

<P>(4) Make noncontroversial changes to regulations. We must determine and 
publish a finding that use of direct final rulemaking, in this situation, is in 
the public interest and unlikely to result in adverse comment.</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Adverse comment.</E>
An adverse comment explains why a rule would be inappropriate, or would be 
ineffective or unacceptable without a change. It may challenge the rule's 
underlying premise or approach. Under the direct final rule process, we do not 
consider the following types of comments to be adverse:
</P>

<P>(1) A comment recommending another rule change, in addition to the change in 
the direct final rule at issue, unless the commenter states why the direct final 
rule would be ineffective without the change.</P>

<P>(2) A frivolous or irrelevant comment.</P>


<P>
(c) 
<E T="03">Confirmation of effective date.</E>
We will publish a confirmation document in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register,</E>
generally within 15 days after the comment period closes, if we have not 
received an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse comment. The 
confirmation document tells the public the effective date of the rule—either the 
date stated in the direct final rule or at least 30 days after the publication 
<PRTPAGE P="15"/>
date of the confirmation document, whichever is later.
</P>


<P>
(d) 
<E T="03">Withdrawing a direct final rule.</E>
(1) If we receive an adverse comment or notice of intent to file an adverse 
comment, we will publish a document in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register</E>
before the effective date of the direct final rule advising the public and 
withdrawing the direct final rule in whole or in part.
</P>

<P>(2) If we withdraw a direct final rule because of an adverse comment, we may 
incorporate the adverse comment into a later direct final rule or may publish a 
notice of proposed rulemaking.</P>


<P>
(e) 
<E T="03">Appeal.</E>
You may appeal PHMSA's issuance of a direct final rule (see § 106.115) only if 
you have previously filed written comments (see § 106.60) to the direct final 
rule.
</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 106.45</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Tracking rulemaking actions.</SUBJECT>

<P>The following identifying numbers allow you to track PHMSA's rulemaking 
activities:</P>


<P>
(a) 
<E T="03">Docket number.</E>
We assign an identifying number, called a docket number, to each rulemaking 
proceeding. Each rulemaking document that PHMSA issues in a particular 
rulemaking proceeding will display the same docket number. This number allows 
you to do the following:
</P>


<P>
(1) Associate related documents that appear in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register.</E>

</P>

<P>(2) Search the DOT Docket Management System (“DMS”) for information on 
particular rulemaking proceedings—including notices of proposed rulemaking, 
public comments, petitions for rulemaking, appeals, records of additional 
rulemaking proceedings and final rules. There are two ways you can search the 
DMS:</P>

<P>(i) Visit the public docket room and review and copy any docketed materials 
during regular business hours. The DOT Docket Management System is located at 
the U.S. Department of Transportation, West Building Ground Floor, Room W12-140, 
1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590-0001.</P>


<P>
(ii) View and download docketed materials through the Internet at 
<E T="03">http://www.regulations.gov.</E>

</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Regulation identifier number.</E>
The Department of Transportation publishes a semiannual agenda of all current 
and projected Department of Transportation rulemakings, reviews of existing 
regulations, and completed actions. This semiannual agenda appears in the 
Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations that is published in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register</E>
in April and October of each year. The semiannual agenda tells the public about 
the Department's—including PHMSA's—regulatory activities. The Department assigns 
a regulation identifier number (RIN) to each individual rulemaking proceeding in 
the semiannual agenda. This number appears on all rulemaking documents published 
in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register</E>
and makes it easy for you to track those rulemaking proceedings in both the 
<E T="04">Federal Register</E>
and the semiannual regulatory agenda itself, as well as to locate all documents 
in the Docket Management System pertaining to a particular rulemaking.

<SUBJECT>Withdrawal.</SUBJECT>


<P>
An application may be withdrawn at any time before a decision to grant or 
<PRTPAGE P="27"/>
deny it is made. Withdrawal of an application does not authorize the removal of 
any related records from the PHMSA dockets or files. Applications that are 
eligible for confidential treatment under § 105.30 will remain confidential 
after the application is withdrawn. The duration of this confidential treatment 
for trade secrets and commercial or financial information is indefinite, unless 
the party requesting the confidential treatment of the materials notifies the 
Associate Administrator that the confidential treatment is no longer required.
</P>

</SECTION>


<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 107.113</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Application processing and evaluation.</SUBJECT>

<P>(a) The Associate Administrator reviews an application for a special permit, 
modification of a special permit, party to a special permit, or renewal of a 
special permit in conformance with the standard operating procedures specified 
in appendix A of this part (“Standard Operating Procedures for Special Permits 
and Approvals”) to determine if it is complete and conforms with the 
requirements of this subpart. This determination will typically be made within 
30 days of receipt of the application for a special permit, modification of a 
special permit, or party to a special permit, and typically within 15 days of 
receipt of an application for renewal of a special permit. If an application is 
determined to be incomplete, the Associate Administrator may reject the 
application. If that occurs, PHMSA will inform the applicant of the deficiency 
in writing.</P>


<P>
(b) An application, that is not a renewal, party to, or emergency special permit 
application, and is determined to be complete is docketed. Notice of the 
application is published in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register,</E>
and an opportunity for public comment is provided. All comments received during 
the comment period are considered before final action is taken on the 
application.
</P>

<P>(c) No public hearing or other formal proceeding is required under this 
subpart before the disposition of an application. Unless emergency processing 
under § 107.117 is requested and granted, applications are usually processed in 
the order in which they are filed.</P>

<P>(d) During the processing and evaluation of an application, the Associate 
Administrator may conduct an on-site review or request additional information 
from the applicant. A failure to cooperate with an on-site review may result in 
the application being deemed incomplete and subsequently being denied. If the 
applicant does not respond to a written or electronic request for additional 
information within 30 days of the date the request was received, the application 
may be deemed incomplete and denied. However, if the applicant responds in 
writing or by electronic means within the 30-day period requesting an additional 
30 days within which it will gather the requested information, the Associate 
Administrator may grant the 30-day extension.</P>

<P>(e) The Associate Administrator may grant or deny an application, in whole or 
in part. In the Associate Administrator's discretion, an application may be 
granted subject to provisions that are appropriate to protect health, safety or 
property. The Associate Administrator may impose additional provisions not 
specified in the application or remove conditions in the application that are 
unnecessary.</P>

<P>(f) The Associate Administrator may grant an application on finding that—</P>

<P>(1) The application complies with this subpart;</P>

<P>(2) The application demonstrates that the proposed alternative will achieve a 
level of safety that:</P>

<P>(i) Is at least equal to that required by the regulation from which the 
special permit is sought, or</P>

<P>(ii) If the regulations do not establish a level of safety, is consistent 
with the public interest and adequately will protect against the risks to life 
and property inherent in the transportation of hazardous materials in 
commerce;</P>

<P>(3) The application states all material facts, and contains no materially 
false or materially misleading statement;</P>

<P>(4) The applicant meets the qualifications required by applicable 
regulations; and</P>


<P>
(5) The applicant is fit to conduct the activity authorized by the special 
permit. This assessment may be based on information in the application, prior 
compliance history of the applicant, 
<PRTPAGE P="28"/>
and other information available to the Associate Administrator.
</P>

<P>(g) An applicant is notified in writing or by electronic means whether the 
application is granted or denied. A denial contains a brief statement of 
reasons.</P>

<P>(h) The initial special permit terminates according to its terms or, if not 
otherwise specified, 24 months from the date of issuance. A subsequent renewal 
of a special permit terminates according to its terms or, if not otherwise 
specified, 48 months after the date of issuance. A grant of party status to a 
special permit, unless otherwise stated, terminates on the date that the special 
permit expires.</P>

<P>(i) The Associate Administrator, on determining that an application concerns 
a matter of general applicability and future effect and should be the subject of 
rulemaking, may initiate rulemaking under part 106 of this chapter in addition

the requirement of the State or political subdivision thereof or Indian tribe 
affords the public a level of safety at least equal to that afforded by the 
requirements of the Federal hazardous material transportation law or the

determining if the requirement of the State or political subdivision thereof or 
Indian tribe unreasonably burdens commerce, the Chief Counsel considers:</P>

<P>(1) The extent to which increased costs and impairment of efficiency result 
from the requirement of the State or political subdivision thereof or Indian 
tribe.</P>

<P>(2) Whether the requirement of the State or political subdivision thereof or 
Indian tribe has a rational basis.</P>

Indian tribe achieves its stated purpose.</P>

<P>(4) Whether there is need for uniformity with regard to the subject concerned 
and if so, whether the requirement of the State or political subdivision thereof 
or Indian tribe competes or conflicts with those of other States or political 
subdivisions thereof or Indian tribes.</P>

<P>(a) In responding to a notice of probable violation under § 107.311, the 
respondent may request a formal administrative hearing on the record before an 
Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) obtained by the Office of the Chief Counsel.</P>

<P>(b) A request for a hearing under paragraph (a) of this section must:</P>

<P>(1) State the name and address of the respondent and of the person submitting 
the request if different from the respondent;</P>

Issues not raised in the request are not barred from presentation at the 
hearing; and</P>

<P>(4) Be addressed to the official who issued the notice.</P>

<P>(c) After a request for a hearing that complies with the requirements of 
paragraph (b) of this section, the Chief Counsel obtains an ALJ to preside over 
the hearing and notifies the respondent of this fact. Upon assignment of an ALJ, 
further matters in the proceeding generally are conducted by and through the 
ALJ, except that the Chief Counsel and respondent may compromise or settle the 
case under § 107.327 of this subpart without order of the ALJ or voluntarily 
dismiss the case under Rule 41(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 
without order of the ALJ; in the event of such a compromise, settlement or 
dismissal, the Chief Counsel expeditiously will notify the ALJ thereof.</P>

<P>(d) At any time after requesting a formal administrative hearing but prior to 
the issuance of a decision and final order by the ALJ, the respondent may 
withdraw such request in writing, thereby terminating the jurisdication of the 
ALJ in the case. Such a withdrawal constitutes an irrevocable waiver of 
respondent's right to such a hearing on the facts, allegations, and proposed 
sanction presented in the notice of probable violation to which the request for 
hearing relates.</P>

<P>(i) A compromise offer stays the running of any response period then 
outstanding.</P>

<P>(ii) If a compromise is agreed to by the parties, the respondent is notified

<P>
The baseline penalty amounts in Part II are used as a starting amount or range 
appropriate for the normal or typical nature, extent, circumstances, and gravity 
of the 
<PRTPAGE P="58"/>
probable violations frequently cited in enforcement reports. PHMSA must also 
consider any additional factors, as provided in 49 U.S.C. 5123(c) and 49 CFR 
107.331, including the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of a violation, 
the degree of culpability and compliance history of the respondent, the 
financial impact of the penalty on the respondent, and other matters as justice 
requires. Consequently, at each stage of the administrative enforcement process, 
up to and including issuance of a final order or decision on appeal, PHMSA can 
adjust the baseline amount in light of the specific facts and circumstances of 
each case.
</P>


<P>
As part of this analysis, PHMSA reviews the factors outlined in the next 
section, 
<E T="03">Miscellaneous Factors Affecting Penalty Amounts,</E>
the safety implications of the violation, the pervasiveness of the violation, 
and all other relevant information. PHMSA considers not only what happened as a 
result of the violation, but also what could have happened as a result of 
continued violation of the regulations. As a general matter, one or more 
specific instances of a violation are presumed to reflect a respondent's general 
manner of operations, rather than isolated occurrences.
</P>


<P>
PHMSA may draw factors relevant to the statutory considerations from the initial 
information gathered by PHMSA's Office of Hazardous Materials Safety Field 
Operations, the respondent in response to an exit briefing, ticket, or Notice of 
Probable Violation (NOPV), or information otherwise available to us. We will 
generally apply the specific statutory factors that are outlined in the next 
section, 
<E T="03">Miscellaneous Factors Affecting Penalty Amounts,</E>
in the following order:
</P>

<P>1. Select the appropriate penalty amount within a specific baseline or range, 
with appropriate increases or decreases depending on the packing group or 
material involved and other information regarding the frequency or duration of 
the violation, the culpability of the respondent, and the actual or potential 
consequences of the violation.</P>

<P>2. Apply decreases for a reshipper or carrier that reasonably relied on an 
offeror's non-compliant preparation of a hazardous materials shipment.</P>

<P>3. Apply increases for multiple counts of the same violation.</P>

<P>4. Apply increases for prior violations of the HMR within the past six 
years.</P>

<P>5. Apply decreases for corrective actions.</P>

<P>6. Apply decreases for respondent's inability to pay or adverse effect on its 
ability to continue in business. </P>

<FP>After each adjustment listed above, PHMSA will use the new modified baseline 
to calculate each subsequent adjustment. PHMSA will apply adjustments separately 
to each individual violation. All penalty assessments will be subject to 
additional adjustments as appropriate to reflect other matters as justice 
requires.</FP>

<HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Respondents That Reship</HD>

<P>A person who either receives hazardous materials from another company and 
reships them (reshipper), or accepts a hazardous material for transportation, 
and transports that material (carrier), is responsible for ensuring that the 
shipment complies in all respects with Federal hazardous materials 
transportation law. In both cases, the reshipper or carrier independently may be 
subject to enforcement action if the shipment does not comply.</P>

<P>Depending on all the circumstances, however, the person who originally 
prepared the shipment and placed it into transportation may have greater 
culpability for the noncompliance than the reshipper or carrier who reasonably 
relies on the shipment as received and does not open or alter the package before 
the shipment continues in transportation. PHMSA will consider the specific 
knowledge and expertise of all parties, as well as which party is responsible 
for compliance under the regulations, when evaluating the culpability of a 
reshipper or carrier. PHMSA recognizes that a reshipper or carrier may have 
reasonably relied upon information from the original shipper and may reduce the 
applicable baseline penalty amount up to 25 percent.</P>

<HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Penalty Increases for Multiple Counts</HD>

<P>A main objective of PHMSA's enforcement program is to obtain compliance with 
the HMR and the correction of violations which, in many cases, have been part of 
a company's regular course of business. As such, there may be multiple instances 
of the same violation. Examples include a company shipping various hazardous 
materials in the same unauthorized packaging, shipping the same hazardous 
material in more than one type of unauthorized packaging, shipping hazardous 
materials in one or more packagings with the same marking errors, or using 
shipping papers with multiple errors.</P>


<P>
Under the Federal hazmat law, 49 U.S.C. 5123(a), each violation of the HMR and 
each day of a continuing violation (except for violations relating to packaging 
manufacture or qualification) is subject to a civil penalty of up to $77,114 or 
$179,933 for a violation occurring on or after August 1, 2016. As such, PHMSA 
generally will treat multiple occurrences that violate a single regulatory 
provision as separate violations and assess the applicable baseline penalty for 
each distinct occurrence of the violation. PHMSA will generally consider 
multiple shipments or, in the case of package testers, multiple package designs, 
to be multiple occurrences; and each shipment or package design may constitute a 
separate violation.
<PRTPAGE P="59"/>

</P>

<P>PHMSA, however, will exercise its discretion in each case to determine the 
appropriateness of combining into a single violation what could otherwise be 
alleged as separate violations and applying a single penalty for multiple counts 
or days of a violation, increased by 25 percent for each additional instance, as 
directed by 49 U.S.C. 5123(c). For example, PHMSA may treat a single shipment 
containing three items or packages that violate the same regulatory provision as 
a single violation and apply a single baseline penalty with a 50 percent 
increase for the two additional items or packages; and PHMSA may treat minor 
variations in a package design for a package tester as a single violation and 
apply a single baseline penalty with a 25 percent increase for each additional 
variation in design.</P>

<P>When aggravating circumstances exist for a particular violation, PHMSA may 
handle multiple instances of a single regulatory violation separately, each 
meriting a separate baseline or increase the civil penalty by 25 percent for 
each additional instance. Aggravating factors may include increased safety 
risks, continued violation after receiving notice, or separate and distinct 
acts. For example, if the multiple occurrences each require their own distinct 
action, then PHMSA may count each violation separately (e.g., failure to obtain 
approvals for separate fireworks devices).</P>

<HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Penalty Increases for Prior Violations</HD>

<P>The baseline penalty in the List of Frequently Cited Violations assumes an 
absence of prior violations. If a respondent has prior violations of the HMR, 
generally, PHMSA will increase a proposed penalty.</P>

<P>When setting a civil penalty, PHMSA will review the respondent's compliance 
history and determine if there are any finally-adjudicated violations of the HMR 
initiated within the previous six years. Only cases or tickets that have been 
finally-adjudicated will be considered (i.e., the ticket has been paid, a final 
order has been issued, or all appeal remedies have been exhausted or expired). 
PHMSA will include prior violations that were initiated within six years of the 
present case; a case or ticket will be considered to have been initiated on the 
date of the exit briefing for both the prior case and the present case. If 
multiple cases are combined into a single Notice of Probable Violation or 
ticket, the oldest exit briefing will be used to determine the six-year period. 
If a situation arises where no exit briefing is issued, the date of the Notice 
of Probable Violation or Ticket will be used to determine the six-year period. 
PHMSA may consider prior violations of the Hazardous Materials Regulations from 
other DOT Operating Administrations.</P>

<P>The general standards for increasing a baseline proposed penalty on the basis 
of prior violations are as follows:</P>

<P>1. For each prior civil or criminal enforcement case—25 percent increase over 
the pre-mitigation recommended baseline penalty.</P>

<P>2. For each prior ticket—10 percent increase over the pre-mitigation 
recommended baseline penalty.</P>

<P>3. If a respondent is cited for operating under an expired special permit and 
previously operated under an expired special permit (as determined in a 
finally-adjudicated civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement case or a 
ticket), PHMSA will increase the civil penalty 100 percent.</P>

<P>4. If a respondent is cited for the exact same violation that it has been 
previously cited for within the six-year period (in a finally-adjudicated civil, 
criminal, or administrative enforcement case or a ticket), PHMSA will increase 
the baseline for that violation by 100 percent. This increase will apply only 
when the present violation is identical to the previous violation and applies 
only to the specific violation that has recurred.</P>

<P>5. A baseline proposed penalty (both for each individual violation and the 
combined total) will not be increased more than 100 percent on the basis of 
prior violations.</P>

<HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Corrective Action</HD>

<P>PHMSA may lower a proposed penalty when a respondent's documented corrective 
action has fixed an alleged violation. Corrective action should demonstrate not 
only that the specific deficiency is corrected but also that any systemic 
corrections have been addressed to prevent recurrence of the violation.</P>

<P>The two primary factors that determine the reduction amount are the extent 
and timing of the corrective action. In other words, PHMSA will determine the 
amount of mitigation based on how much corrective action a respondent completes 
and how soon after the exit briefing it performs corrective action. 
Comprehensive systemic action to prevent future violations may warrant greater 
mitigation than actions that simply target violations identified during the 
inspection. Actions taken immediately (within the 30 calendar day period that 
respondents have to respond to an exit briefing, or upon approval of Field 
Operations) may warrant greater mitigation than actions that are not taken 
promptly.</P>


<P>
PHMSA may consider a respondent's corrective action to assess mitigation at 
various stages in the enforcement process, including: (1) AFTEr an inspection 
and before an NOPV is issued; (2) on receipt of an NOPV; or (3) after receipt of 
an NOPV. In order to reduce a civil penalty for corrective action, PHMSA must 
receive satisfactory documentation that demonstrates the corrective action was 
completed. If a corrective action is of a type that cannot be documented (e.g., 
no longer using a particular 
<PRTPAGE P="60"/>
packaging), then a respondent may provide a signed affidavit describing the 
action it took. The affidavit must begin with the affirmative oath “I hereby 
affirm under the penalties of perjury that the below statements are true and 
correct to the best of my knowledge, information and belief,” in accordance with 
28 U.S.C. 1746.
</P>

<P>Generally, corrective action credit may not exceed 25 percent. Mitigation is 
applied to individual violations and fact patterns but should not be considered 
to be automatic reduction. Thus, in a case with two violations, if corrective 
action for the first violation is more extensive than for the second, the 
penalty for the first will be mitigated more than that for the second. If a 
respondent has previously committed the same violation, however, as determined 
in a finally-adjudicated civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement case or 
a ticket, PHMSA will not apply any reduction for corrective action.</P>

<P>In determining the appropriate civil penalty reduction, PHMSA will consider 
the extent to which the respondent corrected the violation and any risks or 
harms it created, the respondent's actions to prevent the violation from 
recurring, improvements to overall company practices to address a widespread 
compliance issue, and how quickly the corrective action was performed. In 
general, PHMSA will apply the following reductions for corrective action, 
subject to the facts and circumstances of individual cases and respondents. If a 
respondent has given full documentation of timely corrective action and PHMSA 
does not believe that anything else can be done to correct the violation or 
improve overall company practices, we will generally reduce the civil penalty by 
no more than 25 percent. As noted above, a 25 percent reduction is not 
automatic. We will reduce the penalty up to 20 percent when a respondent 
promptly and completely corrected the cited violation and has taken substantial 
steps toward comprehensive improvements. PHMSA will generally apply a reduction 
up to 15 percent when a respondent has made substantial and timely progress 
toward correcting the specific violation as well as overall company practices, 
but additional actions are needed. A reduction up to 10 percent is appropriate 
when a respondent has taken significant steps toward addressing the violation, 
but minimal or no steps toward correcting broader company policies to prevent 
future violations. PHMSA may reduce a penalty up to 5 percent when a respondent 
made untimely or minimal efforts toward correcting the violation.</P>

<HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Financial Considerations</HD>

<P>PHMSA may mitigate a proposed penalty when a respondent documents that the 
penalty would either (1) exceed an amount that the respondent is able to pay, or 
(2) have an adverse effect on the respondent's ability to continue in business. 
These criteria relate to a respondent's entire business, and not just the 
product line or part of its operations involved in a violation. PHMSA may apply 
this mitigation by reducing the civil penalty or instituting a payment plan.</P>

<P>PHMSA will only mitigate a civil penalty based on financial considerations 
when a respondent supplies financial documentation demonstrating one of the 
factors above. A respondent may submit documentation of financial hardship at 
any stage to receive mitigation or an installment payment plan. Documentation 
includes tax records, a current balance sheet, profit and loss statements, and 
any other relevant records. Evidence of a respondent's financial condition is 
used only to decrease a penalty, and not to increase it.</P>

<P>In evaluating the financial impact of a penalty on a respondent, PHMSA will 
consider all relevant information on a case-by-case basis. Although PHMSA will 
determine financial hardship and appropriate penalty adjustments on an 
individual basis, in general, we will consider the following factors.</P>

<P>1. The overall financial size of the respondent's business and information on 
the respondent's balance sheet, including the current ratio (current assets to 
current liabilities), the nature of current assets, and net worth (total assets 
minus total liabilities).</P>

<P>2. A current ratio close to or below 1.0 may suggest that the company would 
have difficulty in paying a large penalty or in paying it in a single lump 
sum.</P>

<P>3. A small amount of cash on hand (representing limited liquidity), even with 
substantial other current assets (such as accounts receivable or inventory), may 
suggest a company would have difficulty in paying a penalty in a single lump 
sum.</P>

<P>4. A small or negative net worth may suggest a company would have difficulty 
in paying a penalty in a single lump sum. Notwithstanding, many respondents have 
paid substantial civil penalties in installments even though net worth was 
negative. For this reason, negative net worth alone does not always warrant 
reduction of a proposed penalty or even, in the absence of factors discussed 
above, a payment plan.</P>

<P>When PHMSA determines that a proposed penalty poses a significant financial 
hardship, we may reduce the proposed penalty and/or implement an installment 
payment plan. The appropriateness of these options will depend on the 
circumstances of the case.</P>


<P>
When an installment payment plan is appropriate, the length of the payment plan 
should be as short as possible, but may be adjusted as necessary. PHMSA will not 
usually exceed six months for a payment plan. 
<PRTPAGE P="61"/>
In unusual circumstances, PHMSA may extend the period of a payment plan. For 
example, the duration of a payment plan may reflect fluctuations in a company's 
income if its business is seasonal or if the company has documented specific 
reasons for current non-liquidity.

<P>An approval for assessing an applicant's ability to perform a function that 
does not involve classifying a hazardous material is described as a 
non-classification approval and certifies that: An approval holder is qualified 
to requalify, repair, rebuild, and/or manufacture cylinders stipulated in the 
HMR; an agency is qualified to perform inspections and other functions outlined 
in an approval and the HMR; an approval holder is providing an equivalent level 
of safety or safety that is consistent with the public interest in the 
transportation of hazardous materials outlined in the approval; and a 
radioactive package design or material classification fully complies with 
applicable domestic or international regulations. An approval for assessing the 
hazard class of a material is described as a classification approval and 
certifies that explosives, fireworks, chemical oxygen generators, self-reactive 
materials, and organic peroxides have been classed for manufacturing and/or 
transportation based on requirements stipulated in the HMR. Registration 
approvals include the issuance of a unique identification number used solely as 
an identifier or in conjunction with approval holder's name and address, or the 
issuance of a registration number that is evidence the approval holder is 
qualified to perform an HMR-authorized function, such as visually requalifying 
cylinders. This appendix does not include registrations issued under 49 CFR part 
107, subpart G.</P>


<P>
1. 
<E T="03">Completeness.</E>
PHMSA reviews all special permit and approval applications to determine if they 
contain all the information required under § 107.105 (for a special permit), 
<PRTPAGE P="76"/>
§ 107.117 (for emergency processing) or § 107.402 (for designation as a 
certification agency) or § 107.705 (for an approval). If PHMSA determines an 
application does not contain all the information needed to evaluate the safety 
of the actions requested in the application, the Associate Administrator may 
reject the application. If the application is rejected, PHMSA will notify the 
applicant of the deficiencies in writing. An applicant may resubmit a rejected 
application as a new application, provided the newly submitted application 
contains the information PHMSA needs to make a determination.
</P>

<P>Emergency special permit applications must comply with all the requirements 
prescribed in § 107.105 for a special permit application, and contain sufficient 
information to determine that the applicant's request for emergency processing 
is justified under the conditions prescribed in § 107.117.</P>


<P>
2. 
<E T="03">Publication.</E>
When PHMSA determines an application for a new special permit or a request to 
modify an existing special permit is complete and sufficient, PHMSA publishes a 
summary of the application in the 
<E T="04">Federal Register</E>
in conformance with § 107.113(b). This provides the public an opportunity to 
comment on a request for a new or a modification of an existing special permit.
</P>


<P>
3. 
<E T="03">Evaluation.</E>
The evaluation phase consists of two assessments, which may be done 
concurrently, a technical evaluation and a safety profile evaluation. When 
applicable, PHMSA consults and coordinates its evaluation of applications with 
the following Operating Administrations (OAs) that share enforcement authority 
under Federal hazardous material transportation law: Federal Aviation 
Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, Federal Railroad 
Administration, and United States Coast Guard. PHMSA also consults other 
agencies with hazardous material subject-matter expertise, such as the Nuclear 
Regulatory Commission and the Department of Energy.
</P>


<P>
(a) 
<E T="03">Technical evaluation.</E>
A technical evaluation considers whether the proposed special permit or approval 
will achieve a level of safety at least equal to that required under the HMR or, 
if a required safety level does not exist, considers whether the proposed 
special permit is consistent with the public interest in that it will adequately 
protect against the risks to life and property inherent in the transportation of 
hazardous material. For a classification approval, the technical evaluation is a 
determination that the application meets the requirements of the regulations for 
issuance of the approval. If formal coordination with another OA is included as 
part of the evaluation phase, that OA is responsible for managing this process 
within the applicable OA. The OA reviews the application materials and PHMSA's 
technical evaluation, and may provide their own evaluation, comments and 
recommendations. The OA may also recommend operational controls or limitations 
to be incorporated into the special permit or approval to improve its safety.
</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Safety profile evaluation.</E>
Each applicant for a special permit or non-classification approval is subject to 
a safety profile evaluation to assess if the applicant is fit to conduct the 
activity authorized by the special permit or approval application. PHMSA will 
coordinate the safety profile evaluations with the appropriate OA if a proposed 
activity is specific to a particular mode of transportation, if the proposed 
activity will set new precedent or have a significant economic impact, or if an 
OA requests participation. PHMSA does not conduct initial safety profile reviews 
as part of processing classification approvals, which include fireworks, 
explosives, organic peroxides, and self-reactive materials. Additionally, 
cylinder approvals and certification agency approvals do not follow the same 
minimum safety profile review model.
</P>


<P>
(i) 
<E T="03">Automated Review.</E>
An applicant for a special permit or approval which requires a safety profile 
evaluation, but does not include coordination with an OA, is subject to an 
automated safety profile review. If the applicant passes the initial automated 
review, the applicant is determined to be fit. If the applicant fails the 
initial automated review, the applicant is subject to a safety profile 
evaluation. An applicant that fails a safety profile evaluation may be 
determined to be unfit. To begin this review, PHMSA or the applicant enters the 
applicant's information into the web-based Hazardous Materials Information 
System (HMIS) or Hazmat Intelligence Portal (HIP), or other future application 
processing technology that provide an integrated information source to identify 
hazardous material safety trends through the analysis of incident and accident 
information, and provide access to comprehensive information on hazardous 
materials incidents, special permits and approvals, enforcement actions, and 
other elements that support PHMSA's regulatory program. PHMSA then screens the 
applicant to determine if, within the four years prior to submitting its 
application, the applicant was involved in any incident attributable to the 
applicant or package where two or more triggers for a safety profile review or 
five or more triggers for on-site inspection enforcement case referral events 
occurred.
</P>


<P>

</ROW>

<TNOTE>* The Fitness Coordinator assesses and applies these triggers.</TNOTE>

</GPOTABLE>

<P>(2) If an applicant is acting as an interstate carrier of hazardous materials 
under the terms of the special permit, they will be screened in an automated 
manner based upon criteria established by FMCSA, such as that contained in its 
Safety and Fitness Electronic Records (SAFER) system, which consists of 
interstate carrier data, several states' intrastate data, interstate vehicle 
registration data, and may include operational data such as inspections and 
crashes.</P>


<P>
(ii) 
<E T="03">Safety profile evaluation.</E>
A fitness coordinator, as defined in § 107.1, conducts a safety profile 
evaluation of all applicants meeting any of the criteria listed earlier in this 
appendix under “automated review,” and all applicants whose safety profile 
evaluations are subject to coordination with an OA, as described in introductory 
paragraph 3(b) of this appendix. In a safety profile evaluation, PHMSA or the OA 
performs an in-depth evaluation of the applicant based upon items the automated 
review triggered concerning the applicant's four-year performance and compliance 
history prior to the submission of the application. Information considered 
during this review may include the applicant's history of prior violations, 
insufficient corrective actions, or evidence that the applicant is at risk of 
being unable to comply with the terms of an application for an existing special 
permit, approval, or the HMR. PHMSA performs the review or coordinates with the 
OAs, if necessary, if two or more modes of transportation are requested in the 
application, and coordinates this review with the OA(s) of the applicable 
mode(s). The applicable OA performs the review if one mode of transportation is 
requested in the application. If necessary, the fitness coordinator will attempt 
to contact the applicant for clarifying information. If the information provided 
is sufficient, an on-site inspection may not be necessary. After conducting an 
evaluation, if the fitness coordinator determines that the applicant may be 
unfit to conduct the activities requested in the application, the coordinator 
will forward the request and supporting documentation to PHMSA's Field 
Operations Division, or a representative of the Department, such as an 
authorized Operating Administration representative, to perform an on-site 
inspection. After the safety profile evaluation is completed, if the applicant 
is not selected for an on-site inspection, the applicant is determined to be 
fit. On-site inspections are not required for fitness determinations from modal 
administrations according to their own procedures.
</P>


<P>
(iii) 
<E T="03">On-Site Inspection.</E>
(A) The factors in paragraph 3(b)(i) and 3(b)(ii) are used as evidence that an 
applicant is at risk of being unable to comply with the terms of an application, 
including those listed below. PHMSA's Field Operations Division or 
representative of the Department, such as an Operating Administration 
representative, will conduct an on-site inspection at the recommendation of the 
fitness coordinator if one of the following criteria applies:
</P>


<P>
(
<E T="03">1</E>
) Any incident listed under automated review in paragraph 3(b)(i) of this 
appendix is attributable to the applicant or package, other than driver error;
</P>


<P>
(
<E T="03">2</E>
) Insufficient Corrective Actions, as defined in § 107.1, in any enforcement 
case for a period of four years prior to submitting the application, except when 
re-inspected with no violations noted; or
</P>


<P>
(
<E T="03">3</E>
) Items noted by an IIA on a cylinder requalifier inspection report, except when 
re-inspected with no violations noted.
</P>


<P>
(B) If, during an inspection, the PHMSA investigator or a representative of the 
Department finds evidence in the four years prior 
<PRTPAGE P="78"/>
to submitting its application that an applicant has not implemented sufficient 
corrective actions for prior violations, or is at risk of being unable to comply 
with the terms of an application for a special permit or approval, an existing 
special permit or approval, or the HMR, then PHMSA will determine that the 
applicant is unfit to conduct the activities requested in an application or 
authorized special permit or approval.
</P>


<P>
4. 
<E T="03">Disposition.</E>
(a) 
<E T="03">Special Permit.</E>
If an application for a special permit is issued, PHMSA provides the applicant, 
in writing, with a special permit and an authorization letter if party status is 
authorized.
</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Approval.</E>
If an application for approval is issued, PHMSA provides the applicant, in 
writing, with an approval, which may come in various forms, including:
</P>

<P>(1) An “EX” approval number for classifying an explosive (including 
fireworks; see §§ 173.56, 173.124, 173.128, and 173.168(a));</P>

<P>(2) A “RIN” (requalification identification number) to uniquely identify a 
cylinder requalification, repair, or rebuilding facility (see § 180.203);</P>

<P>(3) A “VIN” (visual identification number) to uniquely identify a facility 
that performs an internal or external visual inspection, or both, of a cylinder 
in conformance with 49 CFR part 180, subpart C, or applicable CGA Pamphlet or 
HMR provision;</P>

<P>(4) An “M” number for identifying packaging manufacturers (see § 178.3); 
or</P>

<P>(5) A “CA” (competent authority) for general approvals (see §§ 107.705, 
173.185, and 173.230).</P>


<P>
(c) 
<E T="03">Denial.</E>
An application for a special permit or approval may be denied in whole or in 
part. For example, if an application contains sufficient information to 
successfully complete its technical review but the Associate Administrator 
determines the applicant is unfit, the application will be denied. If an 
application for a special permit or an approval is denied, PHMSA provides the 
applicant with a brief statement, in writing, of the reasons for denial and the 
opportunity to request reconsideration (see §§ 107.113(g), 107.402, and 
107.709(f)).
</P>


<P>
(d) 
<E T="03">Reconsideration and Appeal.</E>
(1) 
<E T="03">Special Permit.</E>
If an application for a special permit is denied, the applicant may request 
reconsideration as provided in § 107.123 and, if the reconsideration is denied, 
may appeal as provided in § 107.125. Applicants submitting special permit 
reconsiderations and appeals must do so in the same manner as new applications, 
provided the new submission is sufficiently complete to make a determination.
</P>


<P>
(2) 
<E T="03">Approval.</E>
If an application for an approval is denied, the applicant may request 
reconsideration as provided in § 107.715 and, if the reconsideration is denied, 
may appeal as provided in § 107.717. Applicants submitting approval 
reconsiderations and appeals must do so in the same manner as new applications, 
provided the new submission is sufficiently complete to make a determination.

<SUBJECT>Applicability of Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) to persons and 
functions.</SUBJECT>


<P>
Federal hazardous materials transportation law (49 U.S.C. 5101 
<E T="03">et seq.</E>
) directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish regulations for the safe 
and secure transportation of hazardous materials in commerce, as the Secretary 
considers appropriate. The Secretary is authorized to apply these regulations to 
persons who transport hazardous materials in commerce. In addition, the law 
authorizes the Secretary to apply these regulations to persons who cause 
hazardous materials to be transported in commerce. The law also authorizes the 
Secretary to apply these regulations to persons who manufacture or maintain a 
packaging or a component of a packaging that is represented, marked, certified, 
or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of a hazardous material in 
commerce. Federal hazardous material transportation law also applies to anyone 
who indicates by marking or other means that a hazardous material being 
transported in commerce is present in a package or transport conveyance when it 
is not, and to anyone who tampers with a package or transport conveyance used to 
transport hazardous materials in commerce or a required marking, label, placard, 
or shipping description. Regulations prescribed in accordance with Federal 
hazardous materials transportation law shall govern safety aspects, including 
security, of the transportation of hazardous materials that the Secretary 
considers appropriate. In 49 CFR 1.53, the Secretary delegated authority to 
issue regulations for the safe and secure transportation of hazardous materials 
in commerce to the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator. The 
Administrator issues the Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR 
<PRTPAGE P="98"/>
parts 171 through 180) under that delegated authority. This section addresses 
the applicability of the HMR to packagings represented as qualified for use in 
the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce and to pre-transportation 
and transportation functions.
</P>


<P>
(a) 
<E T="03">Packagings.</E>
Requirements in the HMR apply to each person who manufactures, fabricates, 
marks, maintains, reconditions, repairs, or tests a packaging or a component of 
a packaging that is represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use 
in the transportation of a hazardous material in commerce, including each person 
under contract with any department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, 
legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal government who manufactures, 
fabricates, marks, maintains, reconditions, repairs, or tests a packaging or a 
component of a packaging that is represented, marked, certified, or sold as 
qualified for use in the transportation of a hazardous material in commerce.
</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Pre-transportation functions.</E>
Requirements in the HMR apply to each person who offers a hazardous material for 
transportation in commerce, causes a hazardous material to be transported in 
commerce, or transports a hazardous material in commerce and who performs or is 
responsible for performing a pre-transportation function, including each person 
performing pre-transportation functions under contract with any department, 
agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of 
the Federal government. Pre-transportation functions include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
</P>

<P>(1) Determining the hazard class of a hazardous material.</P>

<P>(2) Selecting a hazardous materials packaging.</P>

<P>(3) Filling a hazardous materials packaging, including a bulk packaging.</P>

<P>(4) Securing a closure on a filled or partially filled hazardous materials 
package or container or on a package or container containing a residue of a 
hazardous material.</P>

<P>(5) Marking a package to indicate that it contains a hazardous material.</P>

<P>(6) Labeling a package to indicate that it contains a hazardous material.</P>

<P>(7) Preparing a shipping paper.</P>

<P>(8) Providing and maintaining emergency response information.</P>

<P>(9) Reviewing a shipping paper to verify compliance with the HMR or 
international equivalents.</P>

<P>(10) For each person importing a hazardous material into the United States, 
providing the shipper with timely and complete information as to the HMR 
requirements that will apply to the transportation of the material within the 
United States.</P>

<P>(11) Certifying that a hazardous material is in proper condition for 
transportation in conformance with the requirements of the HMR.</P>

<P>(12) Loading, blocking, and bracing a hazardous materials package in a 
freight container or transport vehicle.</P>

<P>(13) Segregating a hazardous materials package in a freight container or 
transport vehicle from incompatible cargo.</P>

<P>(14) Selecting, providing, or affixing placards for a freight container or 
transport vehicle to indicate that it contains a hazardous material.</P>


<P>
(c) 
<E T="03">Transportation functions.</E>
Requirements in the HMR apply to transportation of a hazardous material in 
commerce and to each person who transports a hazardous material in commerce, 
including each person under contract with any department, agency, or 
instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal 
government who transports a hazardous material in commerce. Transportation of a 
hazardous material in commerce begins when a carrier takes physical possession 
of the hazardous material for the purpose of transporting it and continues until 
the package containing the hazardous material is delivered to the destination 
indicated on a shipping document, package marking, or other medium, or, in the 
case of a rail car, until the car is delivered to a private track or siding. For 
a private motor carrier, transportation of a hazardous material in commerce 
begins when a motor vehicle driver takes possession of a hazardous 
<PRTPAGE P="99"/>
material for the purpose of transporting it and continues until the driver 
relinquishes possession of the package containing the hazardous material at its 
destination and is no longer responsible for performing functions subject to the 
HMR with respect to that particular package. Transportation of a hazardous 
material in commerce includes the following:
</P>


<P>
(1) 
<E T="03">Movement.</E>
Movement of a hazardous material by rail car, aircraft, motor vehicle, or vessel 
(except as delegated by Department of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170 at 
2(103)).
</P>


<P>
(2) 
<E T="03">Loading incidental to movement of a hazardous material.</E>
Loading of packaged or containerized hazardous material onto a transport 
vehicle, aircraft, or vessel for the purpose of transporting it, including 
blocking and bracing a hazardous materials package in a freight container or 
transport vehicle, and segregating a hazardous materials package in a freight 
container or transport vehicle from incompatible cargo, when performed by 
carrier personnel or in the presence of carrier personnel. For a bulk packaging, 
loading incidental to movement is filling the packaging with a hazardous 
material for the purpose of transporting it when performed by carrier personnel 
or in the presence of carrier personnel (except as delegated by Department of 
Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170 at 2(103)), including transloading.
</P>


<P>
(3) 
<E T="03">Unloading incidental to movement of a hazardous material.</E>
Removing a package or containerized hazardous material from a transport vehicle, 
aircraft, or vessel; or for a bulk packaging, emptying a hazardous material from 
the bulk packaging after the hazardous material has been delivered to the 
consignee when performed by carrier personnel or in the presence of carrier 
personnel or, in the case of a private motor carrier, while the driver of the 
motor vehicle from which the hazardous material is being unloaded immediately 
after movement is completed is present during the unloading operation. (Emptying 
a hazardous material from a bulk packaging while the packaging is on board a 
vessel is subject to separate regulations as delegated by Department of Homeland 
Security Delegation No. 0170 at 2(103).) Unloading incidental to movement 
includes transloading.
</P>


<P>
(4) 
<E T="03">Storage incidental to movement of a hazardous material.</E>
Storage of a transport vehicle, freight container, or package containing a 
hazardous material by any person between the time that a carrier takes physical 
possession of the hazardous material for the purpose of transporting it until 
the package containing the hazardous material has been delivered to the 
destination indicated on a shipping document, package marking, or other medium, 
or, in the case of a private motor carrier, between the time that a motor 
vehicle driver takes physical possession of the hazardous material for the 
purpose of transporting it until the driver relinquishes possession of the 
package at its destination and is no longer responsible for performing functions 
subject to the HMR with respect to that particular package.
</P>

<P>(i) Storage incidental to movement includes—</P>

<P>(A) Storage at the destination shown on a shipping document, including 
storage at a transloading facility, provided the original shipping documentation 
identifies the shipment as a through-shipment and identifies the final 
destination or destinations of the hazardous material; and</P>

<P>(B) A rail car containing a hazardous material that is stored on track that 
does not meet the definition of “private track or siding” in § 171.8, even if 
the car has been delivered to the destination shown on the shipping 
document.</P>

<P>(ii) Storage incidental to movement does not include storage of a hazardous 
material at its final destination as shown on a shipping document.</P>


<P>
(d) 
<E T="03">Functions not subject to the requirements of the HMR.</E>
The following are examples of activities to which the HMR do not apply:
</P>


<P>
(1) Storage of a freight container, transport vehicle, or package containing a 
hazardous material at an offeror facility prior to a carrier taking possession 
of the hazardous material for movement in transportation in commerce or, for a 
private motor carrier, prior to a motor vehicle driver 
<PRTPAGE P="100"/>
taking physical possession of the hazardous material for movement in 
transportation in commerce.
</P>

<P>(2) Unloading of a hazardous material from a transport vehicle or a bulk 
packaging performed by a person employed by or working under contract to the 
consignee following delivery of the hazardous material by the carrier to its 
destination and departure from the consignee's premises of the carrier's 
personnel or, in the case of a private carrier, departure of the driver from the 
unloading area.</P>

<P>(3) Storage of a freight container, transport vehicle, or package containing 
a hazardous material after its delivery by a carrier to the destination 
indicated on a shipping document, package marking, or other medium, or, in the 
case of a rail car, storage of a rail car on private track.</P>

<P>(4) Rail and motor vehicle movements of a hazardous material exclusively 
within a contiguous facility boundary where public access is restricted, except 
to the extent that the movement is on or crosses a public road or is on track 
that is part of the general railroad system of transportation, unless access to 
the public road is restricted by signals, lights, gates, or similar 
controls.</P>

<P>(5) Transportation of a hazardous material in a motor vehicle, aircraft, or 
vessel operated by a Federal, state, or local government employee solely for 
noncommercial Federal, state, or local government purposes.</P>

<P>(6) Transportation of a hazardous material by an individual for 
non-commercial purposes in a private motor vehicle, including a leased or rented 
motor vehicle.</P>

<P>(7) Any matter subject to the postal laws and regulations of the United 
States.</P>


<P>
(e) 
<E T="03">Requirements of other Federal agencies.</E>
Each facility at which pre-transportation or transportation functions are 
performed in accordance with the HMR may be subject to applicable standards and 
regulations of other Federal agencies.
</P>


<P>
(f) 
<E T="03">Requirements of state and local government agencies.</E>
(1) Under 49 U.S.C. 5125, a requirement of a state, political subdivision of a 
state, or an Indian tribe is preempted, unless otherwise authorized by another

</P>

<P>(i) Complying with both the non-Federal requirement and Federal hazardous 
materials transportation law, the regulations issued under Federal hazardous 
material transportation law or a hazardous material transportation security 
regulation or directive issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security is not 
possible;</P>

<P>(ii) The non-Federal requirement, as applied or enforced, is an obstacle to 
accomplishing and carrying out Federal hazardous materials transportation law, 
the regulations issued under Federal hazardous material transportation law, or a 
hazardous material transportation security regulation or directive issued by the 
Secretary of Homeland Security;</P>

<P>(iii) The non-Federal requirement is not substantively the same as a 
provision of Federal hazardous materials transportation law, the regulations 
issued under Federal hazardous material transportation law, or a hazardous 
material transportation security regulation or directive issued by the Secretary 
of Homeland Security with respect to—</P>

<P>(A) The designation, description, and classification of hazardous 
material;</P>

<P>(B) The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and placarding of

<P>(3) Except as specified in this subpart, for a material poisonous (toxic) by 
inhalation, the T Codes specified in Column 13 of the Dangerous Goods List in 
the IMDG Code may be applied to the transportation of those materials in IM, IMO 
and DOT Specification 51 portable tanks, when these portable tanks are 
authorized in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter; and</P>

<P>(4) No person may offer an IM or UN portable tank containing liquid hazardous 
materials of Class 3, PG I or II, or PG III with a flash point less than 100 °F 
(38 °C); Division 5.1, PG I or II; or Division 6.1, PG I or II, for unloading 
while it remains on a transport vehicle with the motive power unit attached, 
unless it conforms to the requirements in § 177.834(o) of this subchapter.</P>


<P>
(d) 
<E T="03">Use of IMDG Code in port areas.</E>
(1) Except for Division 1.1, 1.2, and Class 7 materials, a hazardous material 
being imported into or exported from the United States or passing through the 
United States in the course of being shipped between locations outside the

<SECTION>

<SECTNO>§ 172.101</SECTNO>

<SUBJECT>Purpose and use of hazardous materials table.</SUBJECT>

<P>(a) The Hazardous Materials Table (Table) in this section designates the 
materials listed therein as hazardous materials for the purpose of 
transportation of those materials. For each listed material, the Table 
identifies the hazard class or specifies that the material is forbidden in 
transportation, and gives the proper shipping name or directs the user to the 
preferred proper shipping name. In addition, the Table specifies or references 
requirements in this subchapter pertaining to labeling, packaging, quantity 
limits aboard aircraft and stowage of hazardous materials aboard vessels.</P>


<P>
(b) 
<E T="03">Column 1: Symbols.</E>
Column 1 of the Table contains six symbols (“ + ”, “A”, “D”, “G”, “I” and “W”) 
as follows:
</P>

<P>(1) The plus ( + ) sign fixes the proper shipping name, hazard class and 
packing group for that entry without regard to whether the material meets the 
definition of that class, packing group or any other hazard class definition. 
When the plus sign is assigned to a proper shipping name in Column (1) of the 
§ 172.101 Table, it means that the material is known to pose a risk to humans. 
When a plus sign is assigned to mixtures or solutions containing a material 
where the hazard to humans is significantly different from that of the pure 
material or where no hazard to humans is posed, the material may be described 
using an alternative shipping name that represents the hazards posed by the 
material. An appropriate alternate proper shipping name and hazard class may be 
authorized by the Associate Administrator.</P>


<P>
(2) The letter “A” denotes a material that is subject to the requirements of 
this subchapter only when offered or intended for transportation by aircraft, 
unless the material is a hazardous substance or a hazardous waste. A shipping 
description entry preceded by an 
<PRTPAGE P="147"/>
“A” may be used to describe a material for other modes of transportation 
provided all applicable requirements for the entry are met.
</P>

<P>(3) The letter “D” identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for 
describing materials for domestic transportation but may be inappropriate for 
international transportation under the provisions of international regulations 
(e.g., IMO, ICAO). An alternate proper shipping name may be selected when either 
domestic or international transportation is involved.</P>

<P>(4) The letter “G” identifies proper shipping names for which one or more 
technical names of the hazardous material must be entered in parentheses, in 
association with the basic description. (See § 172.203(k).)</P>

<P>(5) The letter “I” identifies proper shipping names which are appropriate for 
describing materials in international transportation. An alternate proper 
shipping name may be selected when only domestic transportation is involved.</P>

<P>(6) The letter “W” denotes a material that is subject to the requirements of 
this subchapter only when offered or intended for transportation by vessel, 
unless the material is a hazardous substance or a hazardous waste. A shipping 
description entry preceded by a “W” may be used to describe a material for other 
modes of transportation provided all applicable requirements for the entry are 
met.</P>


<P>
(c) 
<E T="03">Column 2: Hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping 
names.</E>
Column 2 lists the hazardous materials descriptions and proper shipping names of 
materials designated as hazardous materials. Modification of a proper shipping 
name may otherwise be required or authorized by this section. Proper shipping 
names are limited to those shown in Roman type (not italics).
</P>

<P>(1) Proper shipping names may be used in the singular or plural and in either 
capital or lower case letters. Words may be alternatively spelled in the same 
manner as they appear in the ICAO Technical Instructions or the IMDG Code. For 
example “aluminum” may be spelled “aluminium” and “sulfur” may be spelled 
“sulphur”. However, the word “inflammable” may not be used in place of the word 
“flammable”.</P>

<P>(2) Punctuation marks and words in italics are not part of the proper 
shipping name, but may be used in addition to the proper shipping name. The word 
“or” in italics indicates that there is a choice of terms in the sequence that 
may alternately be used as the proper shipping name or as part of the proper 
shipping name, as appropriate. For example, for the hazardous materials 
description “Carbon dioxide, solid or Dry ice” either “Carbon dioxide, solid” or 
“Dry ice” may be used as the proper shipping name; and for the hazardous 
materials description “Articles, pressurized pneumatic or hydraulic,” either 
“Articles, pressurized pneumatic” or “Articles, pressurized hydraulic” may be 
used as the proper shipping name.</P>

<P>(3) The word “poison” or “poisonous” may be used interchangeably with the 
word “toxic” when only domestic transportation is involved. The abbreviation 
“n.o.i.” or “n.o.i.b.n.” may be used interchangeably with “n.o.s.”.</P>

<P>(4) Except for hazardous wastes, when qualifying words are used as part of 
the proper shipping name, their sequence in the package markings and shipping 
paper description is optional. However, the entry in the Table reflects the 
preferred sequence.</P>


<P>
(5) When one entry references another entry by use of the word “see”, if both 
names are in Roman type, either name may be used as the proper shipping name 
(e.g., Ethyl alcohol, 
<E T="03">see</E>
Ethanol).
</P>


<P>
(6) When a proper shipping name includes a concentration range as part of the 
shipping description, the actual concentration, if it is within the range 
stated, may be used in place of the concentration range. For example, an aqueous 
solution of hydrogen peroxide containing 30 percent peroxide may be described as 
“Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solution 
<E T="03">with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen

or “Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solution 
<E T="03">with 30 percent hydrogen peroxide.</E>
” Also, the percent sign (%) may be used in place of the word “percent” when 
words in italics containing the word “percent” are used in addition to the 
proper shipping name.
<PRTPAGE P="148"/>

</P>

<P>(7) Use of the prefix “mono” is optional in any shipping name, when 
appropriate. Thus, Iodine monochloride may be used interchangeably with Iodine 
chloride. In “Glycerol alpha-monochlorohydrin” the term “mono” is considered a 
prefix to the term “chlorohydrin” and may be deleted.</P>

<P>(8) Use of the word “liquid” or “solid”. The word “liquid” or “solid” may be 
added to a proper shipping name when a hazardous material specifically listed by 
name may, due to differing physical states, be a liquid or solid. When the 
packaging specified in Column 8 is inappropriate for the physical state of the 
material, the table provided in paragraph (i)(4) of this section should be used 
to determine the appropriate packaging section.</P>


<P>
(9) 
<E T="03">Hazardous wastes.</E>
If the word “waste” is not included in the hazardous material description in 
Column 2 of the Table, the proper shipping name for a hazardous waste (as 
defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter), shall include the word “Waste” preceding 
the proper shipping name of the material. For example: Waste acetone.
</P>


<P>

<E T="03">Mixtures and solutions.</E>
(i) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard class 
that is not identified specifically by name, comprised of a single predominant 
hazardous material identified in the Table by technical name and one or more 
hazardous and/or non-hazardous material, must be described using the proper 
shipping name of the hazardous material and the qualifying word “mixture” or 
“solution”, as appropriate, unless—
</P>

<P>(A) Except as provided in § 172.101(i)(4) the packaging specified in Column 8 
is inappropriate to the physical state of the material;</P>

<P>(B) The shipping description indicates that the proper shipping name applies 
only to the pure or technically pure hazardous material;</P>

<P>(C) The hazard class, packing group, or subsidiary hazard of the mixture or 
solution is different from that specified for the entry;</P>

<P>(D) There is a significant change in the measures to be taken in 
emergencies;</P>

<P>(E) The material is identified by special provision in Column 7 of the 
§ 172.101 Table as a material poisonous by inhalation; however, it no longer 
meets the definition of poisonous by inhalation or it falls within a different 
hazard zone than that specified in the special provision; or</P>

<P>(F) The material can be appropriately described by a shipping name that 
describes its intended application, such as “Coating solution”, “Extracts, 
flavoring” or “Compound, cleaning liquid.”.</P>

<P>(ii) If one or more of the conditions in paragraphs (c)(10)(i)(A) through (F) 
of this section is satisfied then the proper shipping name selection process in 
(c)(12)(ii) must be used.</P>

<P>(iii) A mixture or solution meeting the definition of one or more hazard 
class that is not identified in the Table specifically by name, comprised of two 
or more hazardous materials in the same hazard class, must be described using an 
appropriate shipping description (e.g., “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”). The name 
that most appropriately describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol 
not listed by its technical name in the Table shall be described as “Alcohol, 
n.o.s.” rather than “Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”. Some mixtures may be more 
appropriately described according to their application, such as “Coating 
solution” or “Extracts, flavoring liquid” rather than by an n.o.s. entry. Under 
the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the technical names of at least 
two components most predominately contributing to the hazards of the mixture or 
solution may be required in association with the proper shipping name.</P>

<P>(11) Except for a material subject to or prohibited by § 173.21, § 173.54, 
§ 173.56(d), § 173.56(e), § 173.224(c) or § 173.225(b) of this subchapter, a 
material that is considered to be a hazardous waste or a sample of a material 
for which the hazard class is uncertain and must be determined by testing may be 
assigned a tentative proper shipping name, hazard class, identification number 
and packing group, if applicable, based on the shipper's tentative determination 
according to:</P>

<P>(i) Defining criteria in this subchapter;</P>


<P>
(ii) The hazard precedence prescribed in § 173.2a of this subchapter;

<P>(iii) The shipper's knowledge of the material;</P>

<P>(iv) In addition to paragraphs (c)(11)(i) through (iii) of this section, for 
a sample of a material other than a waste, the following must be met:</P>

<P>(A) Except when the word “Sample” already appears in the proper shipping 
name, the word “Sample” must appear as part of the proper shipping name or in 
association with the basic description on the shipping paper.</P>

<P>(B) When the proper shipping description for a sample is assigned a “G” in 
Column (1) of the § 172.101 Table, and the primary constituent(s) for which the 
tentative classification is based are not known, the provisions requiring a 
technical name for the constituent(s) do not apply; and</P>

<P>(C) A sample must be transported in a combination packaging that conforms to 
the requirements of this subchapter that are applicable to the tentative packing 
group assigned, and may not exceed a net mass of 2.5 kg (5.5 pounds) per 
package. </P>

<P>
(ii) 
<E T="03">Generic or n.o.s. descriptions.</E>
If an appropriate technical name is not shown in the Table, selection of a 
proper shipping name shall be made from the generic or n.o.s. descriptions 
corresponding to the specific hazard class, packing group, hazard zone, or 
subsidiary hazard, if any, for the material. The name that most appropriately 
describes the material shall be used; e.g., an alcohol not listed by its 
technical name in the Table shall be described as “Alcohol, n.o.s.” rather than 
“Flammable liquid, n.o.s.”. Some mixtures may be more appropriately described 
according to their application, such as “Coating solution” or “Extracts, 
flavoring, liquid”, rather than by an n.o.s. entry, such as “Flammable liquid, 
n.o.s.” It should be noted, however, that an n.o.s. description as a proper 
shipping name may not provide sufficient information for shipping papers and 
package markings. Under the provisions of subparts C and D of this part, the 
technical name of one or more constituents which makes the product a hazardous 
material may be required in association with the proper shipping name.
</P>


<P>
(iii) 
<E T="03">Multiple hazard materials.</E>
If a material meets the definition of more than one hazard class, and is not 
identified in the Table specifically by name (e.g., acetyl chloride), the hazard 
class of the material shall be determined by using the precedence specified in 
§ 173.2a of this subchapter, and an appropriate shipping description (e.g., 
“Flammable liquid, corrosive n.o.s.”) shall be selected as described in 
paragraph (c)(12)(ii) of this section.
</P>

<P>(iv) If it is specifically determined that a material is not a forbidden 
material and does not meet the definition of any hazard class, the material is 
not a hazardous material.</P>

(13) 
<E T="03">Self-reactive materials and organic peroxides.</E>
A generic proper shipping name for a self-reactive material or an organic 
peroxide, as listed in Column 2 of the Table, must be selected based on the 
material's technical name and concentration, in accordance with the provisions 
of § 173.224 or § 173.225 of this subchapter, respectively.
</P>

<P>(14) A proper shipping name that describes all isomers of a material may be 
used to identify any isomer of that material if the isomer meets criteria for 
the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and packing group, unless 
the isomer is specifically identified in the Table.</P>


<P>
(15) Unless a hydrate is specifically listed in the Table, a proper shipping 
name for the equivalent anhydrous substance may be used, if the hydrate 
<PRTPAGE P="150"/>
meets the same hazard class or division, subsidiary risk(s) and packing group.
</P>

<P>(16) Unless it is already included in the proper shipping name in the 
§ 172.101 Table, the qualifying words “liquid” or “solid” may be added in 
association with the proper shipping name when a hazardous material specifically 
listed by name in the § 172.101 Table may, due to the differing physical states 
of the various isomers of the material, be either a liquid or a solid (for 
example “Dinitrotoluenes, liquid” and “Dinitrotoluenes, solid”). Use of the 
words “liquid” or “solid” is subject to the limitations specified for the use of 
the words “mixture” or “solution” in paragraph (c)(10) of this section. The 
qualifying word “molten” may be added in association with the proper shipping 
name when a hazardous material, which is a solid in accordance with the 
definition in § 171.8 of this subchapter, is offered for transportation in the 
molten state (for example, “Alkylphenols, solid, n.o.s., molten”).</P>


<P>
(d) 
<E T="03">Column 3: Hazard class or Division.</E>
Column 3 contains a designation of the hazard class or division corresponding to 
each proper shipping name, or the word “Forbidden”.
</P>

<P>(1) A material for which the entry in this column is “Forbidden” may not be 
offered for transportation or transported. This prohibition does not apply if 
the material is diluted, stabilized or incorporated in a device and it is 
classed in accordance with the definitions of hazardous materials contained in 
part 173 of this subchapter.</P>

<P>(2) When a reevaluation of test data or new data indicates a need to modify 
the “Forbidden” designation or the hazard class or packing group specified for a

<E T="03">Column 4: Identification number.</E>
Column 4 lists the identification number assigned to each proper shipping name. 
Those preceded by the letters “UN” are associated with proper shipping names 
considered appropriate for international transportation as well as domestic 
transportation. Those preceded by the letters “NA” are associated with proper 
shipping names not recognized for international transportation, except to and 
from Canada. Identification numbers in the “NA9000” series are associated with 
proper shipping names not appropriately covered by international hazardous 
materials (dangerous goods) transportation standards, or not appropriately 
addressed by international transportation standards for emergency response 
information purposes, except for transportation between the United States and

<E T="03">Column 5: Packing group.</E>
Column 5 specifies one or more packing groups assigned to a material 
corresponding to the proper shipping name and hazard class for that material. 
Class 2, Class 7, Division 6.2 (other than regulated medical wastes), and ORM-D 
materials, do not have packing groups. Articles in other than Class 1 are not 
assigned to packing groups. For packing purposes, any requirement for a specific 
packaging performance level is set out in the applicable packing authorizations 
of part 173. Packing Groups I, II and III indicate the degree of danger 
presented by the material is great, medium or minor, respectively. If more than 
one packing group is indicated for an entry, the packing group for the hazardous 
material is determined using the criteria for assignment of packing groups 
specified in subpart D of part 173. When a reevaluation of test data or new data 
indicates a need to modify the specified packing group(s), the data should be 
submitted to the Associate Administrator. Each reference in this column to a 
material which is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose proper 
shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or “W”, is 
modified to read 
<PRTPAGE P="151"/>

<E T="03">Column 6: Labels.</E>
Column 6 specifies codes which represent the hazard warning labels required for 
a package filled with a material conforming to the associated hazard class and 
proper shipping name, unless the package is otherwise excepted from labeling by 
a provision in subpart E of this part, or part 173 of this subchapter. The first 
code is indicative of the primary hazard of the material. Additional label codes 
are indicative of subsidiary hazards. Provisions in § 172.402 may require that a 
label other than that specified in Column 6 be affixed to the package in 
addition to that specified in Column 6. No label is required for a material 
classed as a combustible liquid or for a Class 3 material that is reclassed as a 
combustible liquid. For “Empty” label requirements, see § 173.428 of this 
subchapter. The codes contained in Column 6 are defined according to the

Columns 8A, 8B and 8C specify the applicable sections for exceptions, non-bulk 
packaging requirements and bulk packaging requirements, respectively, in part 
173 of this subchapter. Columns 8A, 8B and 8C are completed in a manner which 
indicates that “§ 173.” precedes the designated numerical entry. For example, 
the entry “202” in Column 8B associated with the proper shipping name “Gasoline” 
indicates that for this material conformance to non-bulk packaging requirements 
prescribed in § 173.202 of this subchapter is required. When packaging 
requirements are specified, they are in addition to the standard requirements 
for all packagings prescribed in § 173.24 of this subchapter and any other 
applicable requirements in subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter.
</P>

<P>(1) Exceptions. Column 8A contains exceptions from some of the requirements 
of this subchapter. The referenced exceptions are in addition to those specified 
in subpart A of part 173 and elsewhere in this subchapter. A “None” in this 
column means no packaging exceptions are authorized, except as may be provided 
by special provisions in Column 7.</P>


<P>
(2) Non-bulk packaging. Column 8B references the section in part 173 of this 
subchapter which prescribes packaging requirements for non-bulk packagings. A 
“None” in this column means non-bulk packagings are not authorized, except as 
may be provided by special provisions in Column 7. Each reference in this column 
to a material which is a hazardous waste or a hazardous substance, and whose 
proper shipping name is preceded in Column 1 of the Table by the letter “A” or 
“W”, is modified to include “§ 173.203” or “§ 173.213”, as appropriate for

packaging requirements for bulk packagings, subject to the limitations, 
requirements, and additional authorizations of Columns (7) and (8B). A “None” in 
Column (8C) means bulk packagings are not authorized, except as may be provided 
by special provisions in Column (7) and in packaging authorizations Column (8B). 
Additional authorizations and limitations for use of UN portable tanks are set 
forth in Column 7. For each reference in this column to a material that is a

Appendix A to § 172.101—List of Hazardous Substances and Reportable Quantities

1. This appendix lists materials and their corresponding reportable quantities 
(RQ's) that are listed or designated as “hazardous substances” under section 
101(14) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability 
Act, 42 U.S.C. 9601(14) (CERCLA; 42 U.S.C. 9601 
et seq
). This listing fulfills the requirement of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9656(a), that all 
“hazardous substances,” as defined in 42 U.S.C. 9601(14), be listed and 
regulated as hazardous materials under 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127. That definition 
includes substances listed under sections 311(b)(2)(A) and 307(a) of the Federal 
Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U.S.C. 1321(b)(2)(A) and 1317(a), section 3001 
of the Solid Waste Disposal Act, 42 U.S.C. 6921, and section 112 of the Clean 
Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412. In addition, this list contains materials that the 
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has determined to be 
hazardous substances in accordance with section 102 of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9602. 
It should be noted that 42 U.S.C. 9656(b) provides that common and contract 
carriers may be held liable under laws other than CERCLA for the release of a 
hazardous substance as defined in that Act, during transportation that commenced 
before the effective date of the listing and regulating of that substance as a 
hazardous material under 49 U.S.C. 5101-5127.
2. This appendix is divided into two TABLES which are entitled “TABLE 
1—HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES” and “TABLE 2—RADIONUCLIDES.” A 
material listed in this appendix is regulated as a hazardous material and a 
hazardous substance under this subchapter if it meets the definition of a 
hazardous substance in § 171.8 of this subchapter.

3. The procedure for selecting a proper shipping name for a hazardous substance 
is set forth in § 172.101(c).

4. Column 1 of TABLE 1, entitled 
“Hazardous substance”,
contains the names of those elements and compounds that are hazardous 
substances. Following the listing of elements and compounds is a listing of 
waste streams. These waste streams appear on the list in numerical sequence and 
are referenced by the appropriate “D”, “F”, or “K” numbers. Column 2 of TABLE 1, 
entitled 
“Reportable quantity (RQ)”,
contains the reportable quantity (RQ), in pounds and kilograms, for each 
hazardous substance listed in Column 1 of TABLE 1.
5. A series of notes is used throughout TABLE 1 and TABLE 2 to provide 
additional information concerning certain hazardous substances. These notes are 
explained at the end of each TABLE.

6. TABLE 2 lists radionuclides that are hazardous substances and their 
corresponding RQ's. The RQ's in table 2 for radionuclides are expressed in units 
of curies and terabecquerels, whereas those in table 1 are expressed in units of 
pounds and kilograms. If a material is listed in both table 1 and table 2, the 
lower RQ shall apply. Radionuclides are listed in alphabetical order. The RQ's 
for radionuclides are given in the radiological unit of measure of curie, 
abbreviated “Ci”, followed, in parentheses, by an equivalent unit measured in 
terabecquerels, abbreviated “TBq”.

7. For mixtures of radionuclides, the following requirements shall be used in 
determining if a package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance: (i) if the 
identity and quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of each radionuclide in a 
mixture or solution is known, the ratio between the quantity per package (in 
curies or terabecquerels) and the RQ for the radionuclide must be determined for 
each radionuclide. A package contains an RQ of a hazardous substance when the 
sum of the ratios for the radionuclides in the mixture or solution is equal to 
or greater than one; (ii) if the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture or 
solution is known but the quantity per package (in curies or terabecquerels) of 
one or more of the radionuclides is unknown, an RQ of a hazardous substance is 
present in a package when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) of 
the mixture or solution is equal to or greater than the lowest RQ of any 
individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution; and (iii) if the identity of 
one or more radionuclides in a mixture or solution is unknown (or if the 
identity of a radionuclide by itself is unknown), an RQ of a hazardous substance 
is present when the total quantity (in curies or terabecquerels) in a package is 
equal to or greater than either one curie or the lowest RQ of any known 
individual radionuclide in the mixture or solution, whichever is lower.

$ The RQs for all radionuclides apply to chemical compounds containing the 
radionuclides and elemental forms regardless of the diameter of pieces of solid 
material.

† The RQ of one curie applies to all radionuclides not otherwise listed. 
Whenever the RQs in TABLE 1—HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES OTHER THAN RADIONUCLIDES and 
this table conflict, the lowest RQ shall apply. For example, uranyl acetate and 
uranyl nitrate have RQs shown in TABLE 1 of 100 pounds, equivalent to about 
one-tenth the RQ level for uranium-238 in this table.

** The method to determine the RQs for mixtures or solutions of radionuclides 
can be found in paragraph 7 of the note preceding TABLE 1 of this appendix. RQs 
for the following four common radionuclide mixtures are provided: radium-226 in 
secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.053 curie); natural uranium (0.1 
curie); natural uranium in secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.052 curie); 
and natural thorium in secular equilibrium with its daughters (0.011 curie).

*** Indicates that the name was added by PHMSA because it appears in the list of 
radionuclides in 49 CFR 173.435. The reportable quantity (RQ), if not 
specifically listed elsewhere in this appendix, shall be determined in 
accordance with the procedures in paragraph 7 of this appendix.


Appendix B to § 172.101—List of Marine Pollutants

1. See § 171.4 of this subchapter for applicability to marine pollutants. This 
appendix lists potential marine pollutants as defined in § 171.8 of this 
subchapter.

2. Marine pollutants listed in this appendix are not necessarily listed by name 
in the § 172.101 Table. If a marine pollutant not listed by name or by synonym 
in the § 172.101 Table meets the definition of any hazard Class 1 through 8, 
then you must determine the class and division of the material in accordance 
with § 173.2a of this subchapter. You must also select the most appropriate 
hazardous material description and proper shipping name. If a marine pollutant 
not listed by name or by synonym in the § 172.101 Table does not meet the 
definition of any Class 1 through 8, then you must offer it for transportation 
under the most appropriate of the following two Class 9 entries: 
“Environmentally hazardous substances, liquid, n.o.s.,” UN3082, or 
“Environmentally hazardous substances, solid, n.o.s.” UN3077.

3. This appendix contains two columns. The first column, entitled “S.M.P.” (for 
severe marine pollutants), identifies whether a material is a severe marine 
pollutant. If the letters “PP” appear in this column for a material, the 
material is a severe marine pollutant, otherwise it is not. The second column, 
entitled “Marine Pollutant” , lists the marine pollutants.

4. If a material is not listed in this appendix and meets the criteria for a 
marine pollutant as provided in Chapter 2.9 of the IMDG Code, (incorporated by 
reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), the material may be transported as a 
marine pollutant in accordance with the applicable requirements of this 
subchapter.

5. If a material or a solution meeting the definition of a marine pollutant in 
§ 171.8 of this subchapter does not meet the criteria for a marine pollutant as 
provided in section 2.9.3.3 and 2.9.3.4 of the IMDG Code, (incorporated by 
reference; see § 171.7 of this subchapter), it may be excepted from the 
requirements of this subchapter as a marine pollutant if that exception is 
approved by the Associate Administrator.

§ 172.102

Special provisions.

(a) 
General.
When column 7 of the § 172.101 table refers to a special provision for a 
hazardous material, the meaning and requirements of that provision are as set 
forth in this section. When a special provision specifies packaging or packaging 
requirements—
(1) The special provision is in addition to the standard requirements for all 
packagings prescribed in § 173.24 of this subchapter and any other applicable 
packaging requirements in subparts A and B of part 173 of this subchapter; and

(2) To the extent a special provision imposes limitations or additional 
requirements on the packaging provisions set forth in column 8 of the § 172.101

33 Ammonium nitrites and mixtures of an inorganic nitrite with an ammonium salt 
are prohibited.

34 The commercial grade of calcium nitrate fertilizer, when consisting mainly of 
a double salt (calcium nitrate and ammonium nitrate) containing not more than 10 
percent ammonium nitrate and at least 12 percent water of crystallization, is 
not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

35 Antimony sulphides and oxides which do not contain more than 0.5 percent of 
arsenic calculated on the total mass do not meet the definition of Division 6.1.

37 Unless it can be demonstrated by testing that the sensitivity of the 
substance in its frozen state is no greater than in its liquid state, the 
substance must remain liquid during normal transport conditions. It must not 
freeze at temperatures above −15 °C (5 °F).

38 If this material shows a violent effect in laboratory tests involving heating 
under confinement, the labeling requirements of Special Provision 53 apply, and 
the material must be packaged in accordance with packing method OP6 in § 173.225 
of this subchapter. If the SADT of the technically pure substance is higher than 
75 °C, the technically pure substance and formulations derived from it are not 
self-reactive materials and, if not meeting any other hazard class, are not 
subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

39 This substance may be carried under provisions other than those of Class 1 
only if it is so packed that the percentage of water will not fall below that 
stated at any time during transport. When phlegmatized with water and inorganic 
inert material, the content of urea nitrate must not exceed 75 percent by mass 
and the mixture should not be capable of being detonated by test 1(a)(i) or test 
1(a)(ii) in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this 
subchapter).

40 Polyester resin kits consist of two components: A base material (Class 3, 
Packing Group II or III) and an activator (organic peroxide), each separately 
packed in an inner packaging. The organic peroxide must be type D, E, or F, not 
requiring temperature control. The components may be placed in the same outer 
packaging provided they will not interact dangerously in the event of leakage. 
The Packing Group assigned will be II or III, according to the classification 
criteria for Class 3, applied to the base material. Additionally, unless 
otherwise excepted in this subchapter, polyester resin kits must be packaged in 
specification combination packagings based on the performance level of the base 
material contained within the kit.

detonation as tested by one of the tests described in the UN Manual of Tests and 
Criteria, Part I, Test series 1(a) (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). On the 
basis of the results of suitable burning rate tests, and taking into account the 
standard tests in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part III, subsection 
33.2.1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), nitrocellulose membrane filters in 
the form in which they are to be transported that do not meet the criteria for a 
Division 4.1 material are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter. 
Packagings must be so constructed that explosion is not possible by reason of

entry, each with a mass not exceeding 0.5 g, are not subject to the requirements 
of this subchapter when contained individually in an article or a sealed packet.

44 The formulation must be prepared so that it remains homogenous and does not 
separate during transport. Formulations with low nitrocellulose contents and 
neither showing dangerous properties when tested for their ability to detonate, 
deflagrate or explode when heated under defined confinement by the appropriate 
test methods and criteria in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see 
§ 171.7 of this subchapter), nor classed as a Division 4.1 (flammable solid) 
when tested in accordance with the procedures specified in § 173.124 of this 
subchapter (chips, if necessary, crushed and sieved to a particle size of less 
than 1.25 mm), are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

45 Temperature should be maintained between 18 °C (64.4 °F) and 40 °C (104 °F). 
Tanks containing solidified methacrylic acid must not be reheated during 
transport.

46 This material must be packed in accordance with packing method OP6 (see

direct sunshine and stored (or kept) in a cool and well-ventilated place, away 
from all sources of heat.

47 Mixtures of solids that are not subject to this subchapter and flammable 
liquids may be transported under this entry without 
first applying the classification criteria of Division 4.1, provided there is no 
free liquid visible at the time the material is loaded or at the time the 
packaging or transport unit is closed. Except when the liquids are fully 
absorbed in solid material contained in sealed bags, for single packagings, each 
packaging must correspond to a design type that has passed a leakproofness test 
at the Packing Group II level. Small inner packagings consisting of sealed 
packets and articles containing less than 10 mL of a Class 3 liquid in Packing 
Group II or III absorbed onto a solid material are not subject to this 
subchapter provided there is no free liquid in the packet or article.
48 Mixtures of solids that are not subject to this subchapter and toxic liquids 
may be transported under this entry without first applying the classification 
criteria of Division 6.1, provided there is no free liquid visible at the time 
the material is loaded or at the time the packaging or transport unit is closed. 
For single packagings, each packaging must correspond to a design type that has 
passed a leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level. This entry may not be 
used for solids containing a Packing Group I liquid.

49 Mixtures of solids that are not subject to this subchapter and corrosive 
liquids may be transported under this entry without first applying the 
classification criteria of Class 8, provided there is no free liquid visible at 
the time the material is loaded or at the time the packaging or transport unit 
is closed. For single packagings, each packaging must correspond to a design 
type that has passed a leakproofness test at the Packing Group II level.

50 Cases, cartridge, empty with primer which are made of metallic or plastic 
casings and meeting the classification criteria of Division 1.4 are not 
regulated for domestic transportation.

51 This description applies to items previously described as “Toy propellant 
devices, Class C” and includes reloadable kits. Model rocket motors containing 
30 grams or less propellant are classed as Division 1.4S and items containing 
more than 30 grams of propellant but not more than 62.5 grams of propellant are 
classed as Division 1.4C.

52 This entry may only be used for substances that are too insensitive for 
acceptance into Class 1 (explosive) when tested in accordance with Test Series 2 
in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Part I (incorporated by reference; see 
§ 171.7 of this subchapter).

53 Packages of these materials must bear the subsidiary risk label, “EXPLOSIVE”, 
and the subsidiary hazard class/division must be entered in parentheses 
immediately following the primary hazard class in the shipping description, 
unless otherwise provided in this subchapter or through an approval issued by 
the Associate Administrator, or the competent authority of the country of 
origin. A copy of the approval shall accompany the shipping papers.

54 Maneb or maneb preparations not meeting the definition of Division 4.3 or any 
other hazard class are not subject to the requirements of this subchapter when 
transported by motor vehicle, rail car, or aircraft.

55 This device must be approved in accordance with § 173.56 of this subchapter 
by the Associate Administrator.

56 A means to interrupt and prevent detonation of the detonator from initiating 
the detonating cord must be installed between each electric detonator and the 
detonating cord ends of the jet perforating guns before the charged jet 
perforating guns are offered for transportation.

57 Maneb 
or
Maneb preparations stabilized against self-heating need not be classified in 
Division 4.2 when it can be demonstrated by testing that a volume of 1 m
3
of substance does not self-ignite and that the temperature at the center of the 
sample does not exceed 200 °C, when the sample is maintained at a temperature of 
not less than 75 °C ±2 °C for a period of 24 hours, in accordance with 
procedures set forth for testing self-heating materials in the UN Manual of 
Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
58 Aqueous solutions of Division 5.1 inorganic solid nitrate substances are 
considered as not meeting the criteria of Division 5.1 if the concentration of 
the substances in solution at the minimum temperature encountered in transport 
is not greater than 80% of the saturation limit.

59 Ferrocerium, stabilized against corrosion, with a minimum iron content of 10 
percent is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.

61 A chemical oxygen generator is spent if its means of ignition and all or a 
part of its chemical contents have been expended.

62 Oxygen generators (see § 171.8 of this subchapter) are not authorized for 
transportation under this entry.

64 The group of alkali metals includes lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and 
caesium.

65 The group of alkaline earth metals includes magnesium, calcium, strontium, 
and barium.

66 Formulations of these substances containing not less than 30 percent 
non-volatile, non-flammable phlegmatizer are not subject to this subchapter.

70 Black powder that has been classed in accordance with the requirements of 
§ 173.56 
of this subchapter may be reclassed and offered for domestic transportation as a 
Division 4.1 material if it is offered for transportation and transported in 
accordance with the limitations and packaging requirements of § 173.170 of this 
subchapter.
74 During transport, this material must be protected from direct sunshine and 
stored or kept in a cool and well-ventilated place, away from all sources of 
heat.

78 This entry may not be used to describe compressed air which contains more 
than 23.5 percent oxygen. Compressed air containing greater than 23.5 percent 
oxygen must be shipped using the description “Compressed gas, oxidizing, n.o.s., 
UN3156.”

79 This entry may not be used for mixtures that meet the definition for 
oxidizing gas.

81 Polychlorinated biphenyl items, as defined in 40 CFR 761.3, for which 
specification packagings are impractical, may be packaged in non-specification 
packagings meeting the general packaging requirements of subparts A and B of 
part 173 of this subchapter. Alternatively, the item itself may be used as a 
packaging if it meets the general packaging requirements of subparts A and B of 
part 173 of this subchapter.

101 The name of the particular substance or article must be specified.

102 The ends of the detonating cord must be tied fast so that the explosive 
cannot escape. The articles may be transported as in Division 1.4 Compatibility 
Group D (1.4D) if all of the conditions specified in § 173.63(a) of this 
subchapter are met.

103 Detonators which will not mass detonate and undergo only limited propagation 
in the shipping package may be assigned to 1.4B classification code. Mass 
detonate means that more than 90 percent of the devices tested in a package 
explode practically simultaneously. Limited propagation means that if one 
detonator near the center of a shipping package is exploded, the aggregate 
weight of explosives, excluding ignition and delay charges, in this and all 
additional detonators in the outside packaging that explode may not exceed 25 
grams.

105 The word “Agents” may be used instead of “Explosives” when approved by the 
Associate Administrator.

106 The recognized name of the particular explosive may be specified in addition 
to the type.

107 The classification of the substance is expected to vary especially with the 
particle size and packaging but the border lines have not been experimentally 
determined; appropriate classifications should be verified following the test 
procedures in §§ 173.57 and 173.58 of this subchapter.

108 Fireworks must be so constructed and packaged that loose pyrotechnic 
composition will not be present in packages during transportation.

109 Rocket motors must be nonpropulsive in transportation unless approved in 
accordance with § 173.56 of this subchapter. A rocket motor to be considered 
“nonpropulsive” must be capable of unrestrained burning and must not appreciably 
move in any direction when ignited by any means.

110 Fire extinguishers transported under UN1044 and oxygen cylinders transported 
for emergency use under UN1072 may include installed actuating cartridges 
(cartridges, power device of Division 1.4C or 1.4S), without changing the 
classification of Division 2.2, provided the aggregate quantity of deflagrating 
(propellant) explosives does not exceed 3.2 grams per cylinder. Oxygen cylinders 
with installed actuating cartridges as prepared for transportation must have an 
effective means of preventing inadvertent activation.

111 Explosive substances of Division 1.1 Compatibility Group A (1.1A) are 
forbidden for transportation if dry or not desensitized, unless incorporated in 
a device.

113 The sample must be given a tentative approval by an agency or laboratory in 
accordance with § 173.56 of this subchapter.

114 Jet perforating guns, charged, oil well, without detonator may be reclassed 
to Division 1.4 Compatibility Group D (1.4D) if the following conditions are 
met:

a. The total weight of the explosive contents of the shaped charges assembled in 
the guns does not exceed 90.5 kg (200 pounds) per vehicle; and

b. The guns are packaged in accordance with Packing Method US 1 as specified in 
§ 173.62 of this subchapter.

115 Boosters with detonator, detonator assemblies and boosters with detonators 
in which the total explosive charge per unit does not exceed 25 g, and which 
will not mass detonate and undergo only limited propagation in the shipping 
package may be assigned to 1.4B classification code. Mass detonate means more 
than 90 percent of the devices tested in a package explode practically 
simultaneously. Limited propagation means that if one booster near the center of 
the package is exploded, the aggregate weight of explosives, excluding ignition 
and delay charges, in this and all additional boosters in the outside packaging 
that explode may not exceed 25 g.

116 Fuzes, detonating may be classed in Division 1.4 if the fuzes do not contain 
more than 25 g of explosive per fuze and are made and packaged so that they will 
not cause functioning of other fuzes, explosives or other explosive devices if 
one of the fuzes detonates in a shipping packaging or in adjacent packages.

117 If shipment of the explosive substance is to take place at a time that 
freezing 
weather is anticipated, the water contained in the explosive substance must be 
mixed with denatured alcohol so that freezing will not occur.
118 This substance may not be transported under the provisions of Division 4.1 
unless specifically authorized by the Associate Administrator (see UN0143 or 
UN0150 as appropriate).

119 This substance, when in quantities of not more than 11.5 kg (25.3 pounds), 
with not less than 10 percent water, by mass, also may be classed as Division 
4.1, provided a negative test result is obtained when tested in accordance with 
test series 6(c) of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of 
this subchapter).

120 The phlegmatized substance must be significantly less sensitive than dry 
PETN.

121 This substance, when containing less alcohol, water or phlegmatizer than 
specified, may not be transported unless approved by the Associate 
Administrator.

123 Any explosives, blasting, type C containing chlorates must be segregated 
from explosives containing ammonium nitrate or other ammonium salts.

125 Lactose or glucose or similar materials may be used as a phlegmatizer 
provided that the substance contains not less than 90%, by mass, of 
phlegmatizer. These mixtures may be classified in Division 4.1 when tested in 
accordance with test series 6(c) of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, 
see § 171.7 of this subchapter) and approved by the Associate Administrator. 
Testing must be conducted on at least three packages as prepared for transport. 
Mixtures containing at least 98%, by mass, of phlegmatizer are not subject to 
the requirements of this subchapter. Packages containing mixtures with not less 
than 90% by mass, of phlegmatizer need not bear a POISON subsidiary risk label.

127 Mixtures containing oxidizing and organic materials transported under this 
entry may not meet the definition and criteria of a Class 1 material. (See 
§ 173.50 of this subchapter.)

128 Regardless of the provisions of § 172.101(c)(12), aluminum smelting 
by-products and aluminum remelting by-products described under this entry, 
meeting the definition of Class 8, Packing Group II and III may be classed as a 
Division 4.3 material and transported under this entry. The presence of a Class 
8 hazard must be communicated as required by this part for subsidiary hazards.

129 These materials may not be classified and transported unless authorized by 
the Associate Administrator on the basis of results from Series 2 Test and a 
Series 6(c) Test from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of 
this subchapter) on packages as prepared for transport. The packing group 
assignment and packaging must be approved by the Associate Administrator for 
Hazardous Materials Safety on the basis of the criteria in § 173.21 of this 
subchapter and the package type used for the Series 6(c) test.

130 “Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.,” commonly referred to as dry batteries, are 
hermetically sealed and generally utilize metals (other than lead) and/or carbon 
as electrodes. These batteries are typically used for portable power 
applications. The rechargeable (and some non-rechargeable) types have gelled 
alkaline electrolytes (rather than acidic) making it difficult for them to 
generate hydrogen or oxygen when overcharged and therefore, differentiating them 
from non-spillable batteries. Dry batteries specifically covered by another 
entry in the § 172.101 Table must be transported in accordance with the 
requirements applicable to that entry. For example, nickel-metal hydride 
batteries transported by vessel in certain quantities are covered by another 
entry (
see
Batteries, nickel-metal hydride, UN3496). Dry batteries not specifically covered 
by another entry in the § 172.101 Table are covered by this entry (
i.e.,
Batteries, dry, sealed, n.o.s.) and are not subject to requirements of this 
subchapter except for the following:
(a) 
Incident reporting.
For transportation by aircraft, a telephone report in accordance with 
§ 171.15(a) is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous 
evolution of heat (
i.e.,
an amount of heat sufficient to be dangerous to packaging or personal safety to 
include charring of packaging, melting of packaging, scorching of packaging, or 
other evidence) occurs as a direct result of a dry battery. For all modes of 
transportation, a written report submitted, retained, and updated in accordance 
with § 171.16 is required if a fire, violent rupture, explosion or dangerous 
evolution of heat occurs as a direct result of a dry battery or battery-powered 
device.
(b) 
Preparation for transport.
Batteries and battery-powered device(s) containing batteries must be prepared 
and packaged for transport in a manner to prevent:
(1) A dangerous evolution of heat;

(2) Short circuits, including but not limited to the following methods:

(i) Packaging each battery or each battery-powered device when practicable, in 
fully enclosed inner packagings made of non-conductive material;

(ii) Separating or packaging batteries in a manner to prevent contact with other 
batteries, devices or conductive materials (
e.g.,
metal) in the packagings; or
(iii) Ensuring exposed terminals or connectors are protected with non-conductive 
caps, non-conductive tape, or by other appropriate means; and

(3) Damage to terminals. If not impact resistant, the outer packaging should not 
be used as the sole means of protecting the battery terminals from damage or 
short circuiting. Batteries must be securely cushioned and packed to prevent 
shifting which could loosen terminal caps or reorient the terminals to produce 
short circuits. Batteries contained in devices must be securely installed. 
Terminal protection methods include but are not limited to the following:

(i) Securely attaching covers of sufficient strength to protect the terminals;

(ii) Packaging the battery in a rigid plastic packaging; or

(iii) Constructing the battery with terminals that are recessed or otherwise 
protected so that the terminals will not be subjected to damage if the package 
is dropped.

(c) 
Additional air transport requirements.
For a battery whose voltage (electrical potential) exceeds 9 volts—
(1) When contained in a device, the device must be packaged in a manner that 
prevents unintentional activation or must have an independent means of 
preventing unintentional activation (
e.g.,
packaging restricts access to activation switch, switch caps or locks, recessed 
switches, trigger locks, temperature sensitive circuit breakers, 
etc.

t
f
is the temperature in degrees celsius of the liquid during filling, and
α is the mean coefficient of cubical expansion of the liquid between the mean 
temperature of the liquid during filling (t
f
) and the maximum mean bulk temperature during transportation (t
r
) both in degrees celsius.
b. For liquids transported under ambient conditions α may be calculated using 
the formula:


EN21JN01.009

Where:

d
15
and d
50
are the densities (in units of mass per unit volume) of the liquid at 15 °C (59 
°F) and 50 °C (122 °F), respectively.
TP3 The maximum degree of filling (in %) for solids transported above their 
melting points and for elevated temperature liquids shall be determined by the 
following:


ER14JN05.003

§ 172.201

Preparation and retention of shipping papers.

(a) 
Contents.
When a description of hazardous material is required to be included on a 
shipping paper, that description must conform to the following requirements:
(1) When a hazardous material and a material not subject to the requirements of 
this subchapter are described on the same shipping paper, the hazardous material 
description entries required by § 172.202 and those additional entries that may 
be required by § 172.203:

(i) Must be entered first, or

(ii) Must be entered in a color that clearly contrasts with any description on 
the shipping paper of a material not subject to the requirements of this 
subchapter, except that a description on a reproduction of a shipping paper may 
be highlighted, rather than printed, in a contrasting color (the provisions of 
this paragraph apply only to the basic description required by § 172.202(a)(1), 
(2), (3), and (4)), or

(iii) Must be identified by the entry of an “X” placed before the basic shipping 
description required by § 172.202 in a column captioned “HM.” (The “X” may be 
replaced by “RQ,” if appropriate.)

(2) The required shipping description on a shipping paper and all copies of the 
shipping paper used for transportation purposes must be legible and printed 
(manually or mechanically) in English.

(3) Unless it is specifically authorized or required in this subchapter, the 
required shipping description may not contain any code or abbreviation.

(4) A shipping paper may contain additional information concerning the material 
provided the information is not inconsistent with the required description. 
Unless otherwise permitted or required by this subpart, additional 
information must be placed after the basic description required by § 172.202(a).
(5) 
Electronic shipping papers.
For transportation by rail, a rail carrier may accept shipping paper information 
either telephonically (i.e., voice communications and facsimiles) or 
electronically (EDI) from an offeror of a hazardous materials shipment in 
accordance with the provisions in paragraphs (a)(5)(i)-(a)(5)(iv) of this 
section. See § 171.8 for the EDI definition.
(i) When the information applicable to the consignment is provided under this 
requirement the information must be available to the offeror and carrier at all 
times during transport, and the carrier must have and maintain a printed copy of 
this information until delivery of the hazardous materials on the shipping paper 
is complete. When a paper document is produced, the data must be presented as 
required by this subpart.

(ii) The offeror must forward the shipping paper (record) for a loaded movement 
to the carrier prior to shipment unless the carrier prepares the shipping paper 
on behalf of the offeror. The offeror is only relieved of the duty to forward 
the shipping paper once the offeror has received a copy of the shipping paper 
from the carrier;

(iii) A carrier that generates a residue shipping paper using information from 
the previous loaded movement of a hazardous materials packaging must ensure the 
description of the hazardous material that accompanies the shipment complies 
with the offeror's request; and

(iv) 
Verification.
The carrier and the offeror must have a procedure by which the offeror can 
verify accuracy of the transmitted hazard communication information that will 
accompany the shipment.
(b) [Reserved]

(c) 
Continuation page.
A shipping paper may consist of more than one page, if each page is 
consecutively numbered and the first page bears a notation specifying the total 
number of pages included in the shipping paper. For example, “Page 1 of 4 
pages.”
(d) 
Emergency response telephone number.
Except as provided in § 172.604(d), a shipping paper must contain an emergency 
response telephone number and, if utilizing an emergency response information 
telephone number service provider, identify the person (by name or contract 
number) who has a contractual agreement with the service provider, as prescribed 
in subpart G of this part.
(e) 
Retention and Recordkeeping.
Each person who provides a shipping paper must retain a copy of the shipping 
paper required by § 172.200(a), or an electronic image thereof, that is 
accessible at or through its principal place of business and must make the 
shipping paper available, upon request, to an authorized official of a Federal, 
State, or local government agency at reasonable times and locations. For a 
hazardous waste, the shipping paper copy must be retained for three years after 
the material is accepted by the initial carrier. For all other hazardous 
materials, the shipping paper must be retained for two years after the material 
is accepted by the initial carrier. Each shipping paper copy must include the 
date of acceptance by the initial carrier, except that, for rail, vessel, or air 
shipments, the date on the shipment waybill, airbill, or bill of lading may be 
used in place of the date of acceptance by the initial carrier. A motor carrier 
(as defined in § 390.5 of subchapter B of chapter III of subtitle B) using a 
shipping paper without change for multiple shipments of one or more hazardous 
materials having the same shipping name and identification number may retain a 
single copy of the shipping paper, instead of a copy for each shipment made, if 
the carrier also retains a record of each shipment made, to include shipping 
name, identification number, quantity transported, and date of shipment.

entries:
(1) The name of the shipper.

(2) Minimum flashpoint if 60 °C (140 °F) or below (in °C closed cup (c.c.)) in 
association with the basic description. For lab packs packaged in conformance 
with § 173.12(b) of this subchapter, an indication that the lowest flashpoint of 
all hazardous materials contained in the lab pack is below 23 °C or that the 
flash point is not less than 23 °C but not more than 60 °C must be identified on 
the shipping paper in lieu of the minimum flashpoint.

(3) For a hazardous material consigned under an “n.o.s.” entry not included in 
the segregation groups listed in section 3.1.4 of the IMDG Code (IBR see § 171.7 
of this subchapter) but belonging, in the opinion of the consignor, to one of 
these groups, the appropriate segregation group must be shown in association 
with the basic description (for example, IMDG Code segregation group—1 Acids). 
When no segregation group is applicable, there is no requirement to indicate 
that condition.

(j) [Reserved]

(k) 
Technical names for “n.o.s.” and other generic descriptions.
Unless otherwise excepted, if a material is described on a shipping paper by one 
of the proper shipping names identified by the letter “G” in column (1) of the 
§ 172.101 Table, the technical name of the hazardous material must be entered in 
parentheses in association with the basic description. For example “UN 1760, 
Corrosive liquid, n.o.s., (Octanoyl chloride), 8, II”, or “UN 1760, Corrosive 
liquid, n.o.s., 8, II (contains Octanoyl chloride)”. The word “contains” may be 
used in association with the technical name, if appropriate. For organic 
peroxides which may qualify for more than one generic listing depending on 
concentration, the technical name must include the actual concentration being 
shipped or the concentration range for the appropriate generic listing. For 
example, “UN 3102, Organic peroxide type B, solid, 5.2, (dibenzoyl peroxide, 
52-100%)” or “UN 3108, Organic peroxide type E, solid, 5.2, (dibenzoyl peroxide, 
paste, <52%)”. Shipping descriptions for toxic materials that meet the criteria 
of Division 6.1, PG I or II (as specified in § 173.132(a) of this subchapter) or 
Division 2.3 (as specified in § 173.115(c) of this subchapter) and are 
identified by the letter “G” in column (1) of the § 172.101 Table, must have the 
technical name of the toxic constituent entered in parentheses in association 
with the basic description. A material classed as Division 6.2 and assigned 
identification number UN 2814 or UN 2900 that is suspected to contain an unknown 
Category A infectious substance must have the words “suspected Category A 
infectious substance” entered in parentheses in place of the technical name as 
part of the proper shipping description. For additional technical name options, 
see the definition for “Technical name” in § 171.8. A technical name should not 
be marked on the outer package of a Division 6.2 material (see § 172.301(b)).
(1) If a hazardous material is a mixture or solution of two or more hazardous 
materials, the technical names of at least two components most predominately 
contributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution must be entered on the 
shipping paper as required by paragraph (k) of this section. For example, “UN 
2924, Flammable liquid, corrosive, n.o.s., 3 (8), II (contains Methanol, 
Potassium hydroxide)”.

(2) The provisions of this paragraph do not apply—

(i) To a material that is a hazardous waste and described using the proper 
shipping name “Hazardous waste, liquid 
or
solid, n.o.s.”, classed as a miscellaneous Class 9, provided the EPA hazardous 
waste number is included on the shipping paper in association with the basic 
description, or provided the material is described in accordance with the 
provisions of § 172.203(c) of this part.
(ii) To a material for which the hazard class is to be determined by testing 
under the criteria in § 172.101(c)(11).

(iii) If the n.o.s. description for the material (other than a mixture of 
hazardous materials of different classes meeting the definitions of more than 
one hazard class) contains the name of the chemical element or group which is 
primarily responsible for the material being included in the hazard class 
indicated.

(iv) If the n.o.s. description for the material (which is a mixture of hazardous 
materials of different classes meeting the definition of more than one hazard 
class) contains the name of the chemical element or group responsible for the 
material meeting the definition of one of these classes. In such cases, only the 
technical name of the component that is not appropriately identified in the 
n.o.s. description shall be entered in parentheses.

(l) 
Marine pollutants.
(1) If the proper shipping name for a material which is a marine pollutant does 
not identify by name the component which makes the material a marine pollutant, 
the name of that component must appear in parentheses in association with the 
basic description. Where two or more components which make a material a marine 
pollutant are present, the names of at least two of the components most 
predominantly contributing to the marine pollutant designation must appear in 
parentheses in association with the basic description.
(2) The words “Marine Pollutant” shall be entered in association with the 
basic description for a material which is a marine pollutant.
(3) Except for transportation by vessel, marine pollutants subject to the 
provisions of 49 CFR 130.11 are excepted from the requirements of paragraph (l) 
of this section if a phrase indicating the material is an oil is placed in 
association with the basic description.

(4) Except when all or part of transportation is by vessel, marine pollutants in 
non-bulk packagings are not subject to the requirements of paragraphs (l)(1) and 
(l)(2) of this section (see § 171.4 of this subchapter).

(m) 
Poisonous Materials.
Notwithstanding the hazard class to which a material is assigned, for materials 
that are poisonous by inhalation (see § 171.8 of this subchapter), the words 
“Poison-Inhalation Hazard” or “Toxic-Inhalation Hazard” and the words “Zone A”, 
“Zone B”, “Zone C”, or “Zone D” for gases or “Zone A” or “Zone B” for liquids, 
as appropriate, shall be entered on the shipping paper immediately following the 
shipping description. The word “Poison” or “Toxic” need not be repeated if it 
otherwise appears in the shipping description.
(n) 
Elevated temperature materials.
If a liquid material in a package meets the definition of an elevated 
temperature material in § 171.8 of this subchapter, and the fact that it is an 
elevated temperature material is not disclosed in the proper shipping name (for 
example, when the words “Molten” or “Elevated temperature” are part of the 
proper shipping name), the word “HOT” must immediately precede the proper 
shipping name of the material on the shipping paper.
(o) 
Organic peroxides and self-reactive materials.
The description on a shipping paper for a Division 4.1 (self-reactive) material 
or a Division 5.2 (organic peroxide) material must include the following 
additional information, as appropriate:
(1) If notification or competent authority approval is required, the shipping 
paper must contain a statement of approval of the classification and conditions 
of transport.

(2) For Division 4.1 (self-reactive) and Division 5.2 (organic peroxide) 
materials that require temperature control during transport, the control and 
emergency temperature must be included on the shipping paper.

(3) The word “SAMPLE” must be included in association with the basic description 
when a sample of a Division 4.1 (self-reactive) material (see § 173.224(c)(3) of 
this subchapter) or Division 5.2 (organic peroxide) material (see 
§ 173.225(b)(2) of this subchapter) is offered for transportation.

(p) 
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
The word “non-odorized” or “not-odorized” must be included in association with 
the proper shipping description on a shipping paper when non-odorized liquefied 
petroleum gas is offered for transportation.

Class 7 (radioactive) material.

(a) Unless excepted from labeling by §§ 173.421 through 173.427 of this 
subchapter, each package of radioactive material must be labeled as provided in 
this section.

(b) The proper label to affix to a package of Class 7 (radioactive) material is 
based on the radiation level at the surface of the package and the transport 
index. The proper category of label must be determined in accordance with 
paragraph (c) of this section. The label to be applied must be the highest 
category required for any of the two determining conditions for the package. 
RADIOACTIVE WHITE-I is the lowest category and RADIOACTIVE YELLOW-III is the 
highest. For example, a package with a transport index of 0.8 and a maximum 
surface radiation level of 0.6 millisievert (60 millirems) per hour must bear a 
RADIOACTIVE YELLOW-III label.

(d) 
EMPTY label.
See § 173.428(e) of this subchapter for EMPTY labeling requirements.
(e) 
FISSILE label.
For packages required in § 172.402 to bear a FISSILE label, each such label must 
be completed with the criticality safety index (CSI) assigned in the NRC or DOE 
package design approval, or in the certificate of approval for special 
arrangement or the certificate of approval for the package design issued by the 
Competent Authority for import and export shipments. For overpacks and freight 
containers required in § 172.402 to bear a FISSILE label, the CSI on the label 
must be the sum of the CSIs for all of the packages contained in the overpack or 
freight container.
(f) Each package required by this section to be labeled with a RADIOACTIVE label 
must have two of these labels, affixed to opposite sides of the package. (See 
§ 172.406(e)(3) for freight container label requirements).

(g) The following applicable items of information must be entered in the blank 
spaces on the RADIOACTIVE label by legible printing (manual or mechanical), 
using a durable weather resistant means of marking:

(1) 
Contents.
Except for LSA-1 material, the names of the radionuclides as taken from the 
listing of radionuclides in § 173.435 of this subchapter (symbols which conform 
to established radiation protection terminology are authorized, 
i.e.
, 
99
Mo, 
60
Co, etc.). For mixtures of radionuclides, with consideration of space available 
on the label, the radionuclides that must be shown must be determined in 
accordance with § 173.433(g) of this subchapter. For LSA-I material, the term 
“LSA-I” may be used in place of the names of the radionuclides.
(2) 
Activity.
The maximum activity of the radioactive contents in the package during transport 
must be expressed in appropriate SI units (
e.g.,
Becquerels (Bq), Terabecquerels (TBq)). The activity may also be stated in 
appropriate customary units (
e.g.,
Curies (Ci), milliCuries (mCi), microCuries (uCi)) in parentheses following the 
SI units. Abbreviations are authorized. Except for plutonium-239 and 
plutonium-241, the weight in grams or kilograms of fissile radionuclides (or the 
mass of each fissile nuclide for mixtures when appropriate) may be inserted 
instead of activity units. For plutonium-239 and plutonium-241, the weight in 
grams of fissile radionuclides (or the mass of each fissile nuclide for mixtures

Transport index.
(see § 173.403 of this subchapter.)
(h) When one or more packages of Class 7 (radioactive) material are placed 
within an overpack, the overpack must be labeled as prescribed in this section, 
except as follows:

(1) The “contents” entry on the label may state “mixed” in place of the names of 
the radionuclides unless each inside package contains the same radionuclide(s).

(2) The “activity” entry on the label must be determined by adding together the 
number of becquerels of the Class 7 (radioactive) materials packages contained 
therein.

(3) For an overpack, the transport index (TI) must be determined by adding 
together the transport indices of the Class 7 (radioactive) materials 
packages contained therein, except that for a rigid overpack, the transport 
index (TI) may alternatively be determined by direct measurement as prescribed 
in § 173.403 of this subchapter under the definition for “transport index,” 
taken by the person initially offering the packages contained within the 
overpack for shipment.
(4) The category of Class 7 label for the overpack must be determined from the 
table in § 172.403(c) using the TI derived according to paragraph (h)(3) of this 
section, and the maximum radiation level on the surface of the overpack.

(5) The category of the Class 7 label of the overpack, and not that of any of 
the packages contained therein, must be used in accordance with Table 1 of 
§ 172.504(e) to determine when the transport vehicle must be placarded.

(6) For fissile material, the criticality safety index which must be entered on 
the overpack FISSILE label is the sum of the criticality safety indices of the 
individual packages in the overpack, as stated in the certificate of approval 
for the package design issued by the NRC or the U.S. Competent Authority.

§ 172.504

General placarding requirements.

(a) 
General.
Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, each bulk packaging, freight 
container, unit load device, transport vehicle or rail car containing any 
quantity of a hazardous material must be placarded on each side and each end 
with the type of placards specified in tables 1 and 2 of this section and in 
accordance with other placarding requirements of this subpart, including the 
specifications for the placards named in the tables and described in detail in 
§§ 172.519 through 172.560.
(b) 
DANGEROUS placard.
A freight container, unit load device, transport vehicle, or rail car which 
contains non-bulk packages with two or more categories of hazardous materials 
that require different placards specified in table 2 of paragraph (e) of this 
section may be placarded with a DANGEROUS placard instead of the separate 
placarding specified for each of the materials in table 2 of paragraph (e) of 
this section. However, when 1,000 kg (2,205 pounds) aggregate gross weight or 
more of one category of material is loaded therein at one loading facility on a 
freight container, unit load device, transport vehicle, or rail car, the placard 
specified in table 2 of paragraph (e) of this section for that category must be 
applied.
(c) 
Exception for less than 454 kg (1,001 pounds).
Except for bulk packagings and hazardous materials subject to § 172.505, when 
hazardous materials covered by table 2 of this section are transported by 
highway or rail, placards are not required on—
(1) A transport vehicle or freight container which contains less than 454 kg 
(1001 pounds) aggregate gross weight of hazardous materials covered by table 2 
of paragraph (e) of this section; or

(2) A rail car loaded with transport vehicles or freight containers, none of 
which is required to be placarded.

The exceptions provided in paragraph (c) of this section do not prohibit the 
display of placards in the manner prescribed in this subpart, if not otherwise 
prohibited (see § 172.502), on transport vehicles or freight containers which 
are not required to be placarded.

(d) 
Exception for empty non-bulk packages.
Except for hazardous materials subject to § 172.505, a non-bulk packaging that 
contains only the residue of a hazardous material covered by Table 2 of

§ 172.516

Visibility and display of placards.

(a) Each placard on a motor vehicle and each placard on a rail car must be 
clearly visible from the direction it faces, except from the direction of 
another transport vehicle or rail car to which the motor vehicle or rail car is 
coupled. This requirement may be met by the placards displayed on the freight 
containers or portable tanks loaded on a motor vehicle or rail car.

(b) The required placarding of the front of a motor vehicle may be on the front 
of a truck-tractor instead of or in addition to the placarding on the front of 
the cargo body to which a truck-tractor is attached.

(c) Each placard on a transport vehicle, bulk packaging, freight container or 
aircraft unit load device must—

(1) Be securely attached or affixed thereto or placed in a holder thereon. (See 
appendix C to this part.);

(2) Be located clear of appurtenances and devices such as ladders, pipes, doors, 
and tarpaulins;

(3) So far as practicable, be located so that dirt or water is not directed to 
it from the wheels of the transport vehicle;

(4) Be located away from any marking (such as advertising) that could 
substantially reduce its effectiveness, and in any case at least 3 inches (76.0 
mm.) away from such marking;

(5) Have the words or identification number (when authorized) printed on it 
displayed horizontally, reading from left to right;

(6) Be maintained by the carrier in a condition so that the format, legibility, 
color, and visibility of the placard will not be substantially reduced due to 
damage, deterioration, or obscurement by dirt or other matter;

(7) Be affixed to a background of contrasting color, or must have a dotted or 
solid line outer border which contrasts with the background color.

(d) Recommended specifications for a placard holder are set forth in appendix C 
of this part. Except for a placard holder similar to that contained in appendix 
C to this part, the means used to attach a placard may not obscure any part of 
its surface other than the borders.

§ 172.519

General specifications for placards.

(a) 
Strength and durability.
Placards must conform to the following:
(1) A placard may be made of any plastic, metal or other material capable of 
withstanding, without deterioration or a substantial reduction in effectiveness, 
a 30-day exposure to open weather conditions.

(2) A placard made of tagboard must be at least equal to that designated 
commercially as white tagboard. Tagboard must have a weight of at least 80 kg 
(176 pounds) per ream of 610 by 910 
mm (24 by 36-inch) sheets, waterproofing materials included. In addition, each 
placard made of tagboard must be able to pass a 414 kPa (60 p.s.i.) Mullen test.
(3) Reflective or retroreflective materials may be used on a placard if the 
prescribed colors, strength and durability are maintained.

(b) 
Design.
(1) Except as provided in § 172.332 of this part, each placard must be as 
described in this subpart, and except for size and color, the printing, inner 
border and symbol must be as shown in §§ 172.521 through 172.560 of this 
subpart, as appropriate.
(2) The dotted line border shown on each placard is not part of the placard 
specification. However, a dotted or solid line outer border may be used when 
needed to indicate the full size of a placard that is part of a larger format or 
is on a background of a non-contrasting color.

(3) For other than Class 7 or the DANGEROUS placard, text indicating a hazard 
(for example, “FLAMMABLE”) is not required. Text may be omitted from the OXYGEN 
placard only if the specific identification number is displayed on the placard.

(4) For a placard corresponding to the primary or subsidiary hazard class of a 
material, the hazard class or division number must be displayed in the lower 
corner of the placard. However, a permanently affixed subsidiary placard meeting 
the specifications of this section which were in effect on October 1, 2001, 
(such as, a placard without the hazard class or division number displayed in the 
lower corner of the placard) and which was installed prior to September 30, 
2001, may continue to be used as a subsidiary placard in domestic transportation 
by rail or highway, provided the color tolerances are maintained and are in 
accordance with the display requirements in this subchapter.

(c) 
Size.
(1) Each diamond (square-on-point) placard prescribed in this subpart must 
measure at least 250 mm (9.84 inches) on each side and must have a solid line 
inner border 12.5 mm inside and parallel to the edge. The 12.5 mm measurement is 
from the outside edge of the placard to the outside of the solid line forming 
the inner border.
(i) 
Transitional exceptions.
A placard in conformance with the requirements of this paragraph in effect on 
December 31, 2014, may continue to be used until December 31, 2016.
(ii) For domestic transportation, a placard manufactured prior to January 1, 
2017 in conformance with the requirements of this paragraph in effect on 
December 31, 2014, may continue in service until the end of its useful life 
provided the color tolerances are maintained and are in accordance with the 
display requirements of this subchapter.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the hazard class or division 
number, as appropriate, must be shown in numerals measuring at least 41 mm (1.6 
inches) in height.

(3) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, when text indicating a hazard 
is displayed on a placard, the printing must be in letters measuring at least 41 
mm (1.6 inches) in height.

(d) 
Color.
(1) The background color, symbol, text, numerals and inner border on a placard 
must be as specified in §§ 172.521 through 172.560 of this subpart, as 
appropriate.
(2) Black and any color on a placard must be able to withstand, without 
substantial change—

(i) A 72-hour fadeometer test (for a description of equipment designed for this 
purpose, see ASTM G 23-69 or ASTM G 26-70); and

(ii) A 30-day exposure to open weather.

(3) Upon visual examination, a color on a placard must fall within the color 
tolerances displayed on the appropriate Hazardous Materials Label and Placard 
Color Tolerance Chart (see § 172.407(d)(4)). As an alternative, the PANTONE ® 
formula guide coated/uncoated as specified for colors in § 172.407(d)(5) may be 
used.

(4) The placard color must extend to the inner border and may extend to the edge 
of the placard in the area designated on each placard except the color on the 
CORROSIVE and RADIOACTIVE placards (black and yellow, respectively) must extend 
only to the inner border.

(e) 
Form identification.
A placard may contain form identification information, including the name of its 
maker, 
provided that information is printed outside of the solid line inner border in 
no larger than 10-point type.
(f) 
Exceptions.
When hazardous materials are offered for transportation or transported under the 
provisions of subpart C of part 171 of this subchapter, a placard conforming to 
the specifications in the ICAO Technical Instructions, the IMDG Code, or the 
Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) may be 
used in place of a corresponding placard conforming to the requirements of this 
subpart. However, a bulk packaging, transport vehicle, or freight container 
containing a material poisonous by inhalation (see § 171.8 of this subchapter) 
must be placarded in accordance with this subpart (see § 171.23(b)(10) of this 
subchapter).
(g) 
Trefoil symbol.
The trefoil symbol on the RADIOACTIVE placard must meet the appropriate 
specification in appendix B of this part.

§ 172.802

Components of a security plan.

(a) The security plan must include an assessment of transportation security 
risks for shipments of the hazardous materials listed in § 172.800, including 
site-specific or location-specific risks associated with facilities at which the 
hazardous materials listed in § 172.800 are prepared for transportation, stored, 
or unloaded incidental to movement, and appropriate measures to address the 
assessed risks. Specific measures put into place by the plan may vary 
commensurate with the level of threat at a particular time. At a minimum, a 
security plan must include the following elements:

(1) 
Personnel security.
Measures to confirm information provided by job applicants hired for positions 
that involve access to and handling of the hazardous materials covered by the 
security plan. Such confirmation system must be consistent with applicable 
Federal and State laws and requirements concerning employment practices and 
individual privacy.
(2) 
Unauthorized access.
Measures to address the assessed risk that unauthorized persons may gain access 
to the hazardous materials covered by the security plan or transport conveyances 
being prepared for transportation of the hazardous materials covered by the 
security plan.
(3) 
En route security.
Measures to address the assessed security risks of shipments of hazardous 
materials covered by the security plan en route from origin to destination, 
including shipments stored incidental to movement.
(b) The security plan must also include the following:

(1) Identification by job title of the senior management official responsible 
for overall development and implementation of the security plan;

(2) Security duties for each position or department that is responsible for 
implementing the plan or a portion of the plan and the process of notifying 
employees when specific elements of the security plan must be implemented; and

(3) A plan for training hazmat employees in accordance with § 172.704 (a)(4) and 
(a)(5) of this part.

(c) The security plan, including the transportation security risk assessment 
developed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, must be in writing 
and must be retained for as long as it remains in effect. The security plan must 
be reviewed at least annually and revised and/or updated as necessary to reflect 
changing circumstances. The most recent version of the security plan, or 
portions thereof, must be available to the employees who are responsible for 
implementing it, consistent with personnel security clearance or background 
investigation restrictions and a demonstrated need to know. When the security 
plan is updated or revised, all employees responsible for implementing it must 
be notified and all copies of the plan must be maintained as of the date of the 
most recent revision.

(d) Each person required to develop and implement a security plan in accordance 
with this subpart must maintain a copy of the security plan (or an electronic 
file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place of business 
and must make the security plan available upon request, at a reasonable time and 
location, to an authorized official of the Department of 
Transportation or the Department of Homeland Security.
[68 FR 14521, Mar. 25, 2003, as amended at 75 FR 10989, Mar. 9, 2010]


§ 172.804

Relationship to other Federal requirements.

To avoid unnecessary duplication of security requirements, security plans that 
conform to regulations, standards, protocols, or guidelines issued by other 
Federal agencies, international organizations, or industry organizations may be 
used to satisfy the requirements in this subpart, provided such security plans 
address the requirements specified in this subpart.


§ 172.820

Additional planning requirements for transportation by rail.

(a) 
General.
Each rail carrier transporting in commerce one or more of the following 
materials is subject to the additional safety and security planning requirements 
of this section:
(1) More than 2,268 kg (5,000 lbs) in a single carload of a Division 1.1, 1.2 or 
1.3 explosive;

(2) A quantity of a material poisonous by inhalation in a single bulk packaging;

(3) A highway route-controlled quantity of a Class 7 (radioactive) material, as 
defined in § 173.403 of this subchapter; or

(4) A high-hazard flammable train (HHFT) as defined in § 171.8 of this 
subchapter.

(b) Not later than 90 days after the end of each calendar year, a rail carrier 
must compile commodity data for the previous calendar year for the materials 
listed in paragraph (a) of this section. The following stipulations apply to 
data collected:

(1) Commodity data must be collected by route, a line segment or series of line 
segments as aggregated by the rail carrier. Within the rail carrier selected 
route, the commodity data must identify the geographic location of the route and 
the total number of shipments by UN identification number for the materials 
specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(i) A rail carrier subject to additional planning requirements of this section 
based on paragraph (a)(4) of this section, must complete the initial process by 
March 31, 2016, using data for the six month period from July 1, 2015 to 
December 31, 2015; or

(ii) A rail carrier subject to additional planning requirements of this section 
based on paragraph (a)(4) of this section, must complete the initial process by 
March 31, 2016, using data for all of 2015, provided the rail carrier indicates 
in their initial analysis that it has chosen this option.

(2) A carrier may compile commodity data, by UN number, for all Class 7 
materials transported (instead of only highway route controlled quantities of 
Class 7 materials) and for all Division 6.1 materials transported (instead of 
only Division 6.1 poison inhalation hazard materials).

(c) 
Rail transportation route analysis.
For each calendar year, a rail carrier must analyze the safety and security 
risks for the transportation route(s), identified in the commodity data 
collected as required by paragraph (b) of this section. The route analysis must 
be in writing and include the factors contained in appendix D to this part, as 
applicable.
(1) The safety and security risks present must be analyzed for the route and 
railroad facilities along the route. For purposes of this section, railroad 
facilities are railroad property including, but not limited to, classification 
and switching yards, storage facilities, and non-private sidings. This term does 
not include an offeror's facility, private track, private siding, or consignee's 
facility.

(2) In performing the analysis required by this paragraph, the rail carrier must 
seek relevant information from state, local, and tribal officials, as 
appropriate, regarding security risks to high-consequence targets along or in 
proximity to the route(s) utilized. If a rail carrier is unable to acquire 
relevant information from state, local, or tribal officials, then it must 
document that in its analysis. For purposes of this section, a high-consequence 
target means a property, natural resource, location, area, or other target 
designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security that is a viable terrorist 
target of national significance, the attack of which by railroad could result in 
catastrophic 
loss of life, significant damage to national security or defense capabilities, 
or national economic harm.
(d) 
Alternative route analysis.
(1) For each calendar year, a rail carrier must identify practicable alternative 
routes over which it has authority to operate, if an alternative exists, as an 
alternative route for each of the transportation routes analyzed in accordance 
with paragraph (c) of this section. The carrier must perform a safety and 
security risk assessment of the alternative routes for comparison to the route 
analysis prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section. The alternative route 
analysis must be in writing and include the criteria in appendix D of this part. 
When determining practicable alternative routes, the rail carrier must consider 
the use of interchange agreements with other rail carriers. The written 
alternative route analysis must also consider:
(i) Safety and security risks presented by use of the alternative route(s);

(ii) Comparison of the safety and security risks of the alternative(s) to the 
primary rail transportation route, including the risk of a catastrophic release 
from a shipment traveling along each route;

(iii) Any remediation or mitigation measures implemented on the primary or 
alternative route(s); and

(iv) Potential economic effects of using the alternative route(s), including but 
not limited to the economics of the commodity, route, and customer relationship.

(2) In performing the analysis required by this paragraph, the rail carrier 
should seek relevant information from state, local, and tribal officials, as 
appropriate, regarding security risks to high-consequence targets along or in 
proximity to the alternative routes. If a rail carrier determines that it is not 
appropriate to seek such relevant information, then it must explain its 
reasoning for that determination in its analysis.

(e) 
Route Selection.
A carrier must use the analysis performed as required by paragraphs (c) and (d) 
of this section to select the route to be used in moving the materials covered 
by paragraph (a) of this section. The carrier must consider any remediation 
measures implemented on a route. Using this process, the carrier must at least 
annually review and select the practicable route posing the least overall safety 
and security risk. The rail carrier must retain in writing all route review and 
selection decision documentation and restrict the distribution, disclosure, and 
availability of information contained in the route analysis to covered persons 
with a need-to-know, as described in parts 15 and 1520 of this title. This 
documentation should include, but is not limited to, comparative analyses, 
charts, graphics or rail system maps.
(f) 
Completion of route analysis.
(1) The rail transportation route analysis, alternative route analysis, and 
route selection process required under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this 
section must be completed no later than the end of the calendar year following 
the year to which the analyses apply.
(2) The initial analysis and route selection determinations required under 
paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section must include a comprehensive review 
of the entire system. Subsequent analyses and route selection determinations 
required under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section must include a 
comprehensive, system-wide review of all operational changes, infrastructure 
modifications, traffic adjustments, changes in the nature of high-consequence 
targets located along, or in proximity to, the route, and any other changes 
affecting the safety or security of the movements of the materials specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section that were implemented during the calendar year.

(3) A rail carrier need not perform a rail transportation route analysis, 
alternative route analysis, or route selection process for any hazardous 
material other than the materials specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

(g) 
Rail carrier point of contact on routing issues.
Each rail carrier must identify a point of contact (including the name, title, 
phone number and e-mail address) on routing issues involving the movement of 
materials covered by this section in its security plan and provide this 
information to:

(1) State and/or regional Fusion Centers that have been established to 
coordinate with state, local and tribal officials on security issues and which 
are located within the area encompassed by the rail carrier's rail system; and

(2) State, local, and tribal officials in jurisdictions that may be affected by 
a rail carrier's routing decisions and who directly contact the railroad to 
discuss routing decisions.

(h) 
Storage, delays in transit, and notification.
With respect to the materials specified in paragraph (a) of this section, each 
rail carrier must ensure the safety and security plan it develops and implements 
under this subpart includes all of the following:
(1) A procedure under which the rail carrier must consult with offerors and 
consignees in order to develop measures for minimizing, to the extent 
practicable, the duration of any storage of the material incidental to movement 
(see § 171.8 of this subchapter).

(2) Measures to prevent unauthorized access to the materials during storage or 
delays in transit.

(3) Measures to mitigate risk to population centers associated with in-transit 
storage.

(4) Measures to be taken in the event of an escalating threat level for 
materials stored in transit.

(5) Procedures for notifying the consignee in the event of a significant delay 
during transportation; such notification must be completed within 48 hours after 
the carrier has identified the delay and must include a revised delivery 
schedule. A significant delay is one that compromises the safety or security of 
the hazardous material or delays the shipment beyond its normal expected or 
planned shipping time. Notification should be made by a method acceptable to 
both the rail carrier and consignee.

(i) 
Recordkeeping.
(1) Each rail carrier must maintain a copy of the information specified in 
paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section (or an electronic image 
thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place of business and 
must make the record available upon request, at a reasonable time and location, 
to an authorized official of the Department of Transportation or the Department 
of Homeland Security. Records must be retained for a minimum of two years.
(2) Each rail carrier must restrict the distribution, disclosure, and 
availability of information collected or developed in accordance with paragraphs 
(c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section to covered persons with a need-to-know, 
as described in parts 15 and 1520 of this title.

(j) 
Compliance and enforcement.
If the carrier's route selection documentation and underlying analyses are found 
to be deficient, the carrier may be required to revise the analyses or make 
changes in route selection. If DOT finds that a chosen route is not the safest 
and most secure practicable route available, the FRA Associate Administrator for 
Safety, in consultation with TSA, may require the use of an alternative route. 
Prior to making such a determination, FRA and TSA will consult with the Surface 
Transportation Board (STB) regarding whether the contemplated alternative 
route(s) would be economically practicable.

§ 172.822

Limitation on actions by states, local governments, and Indian tribes.

A law, order, or other directive of a state, political subdivision of a state, 
or an Indian tribe that designates, limits, or prohibits the use of a rail line 
(other than a rail line owned by a state, political subdivision of a state, or 
an Indian tribe) for the transportation of hazardous materials, including, but 
not limited to, the materials specified in § 172.820(a), is preempted. 49 U.S.C.

Appendix A to Part 172—Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation Color 
Tolerance Charts and Tables

The following are Munsell notations and Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage 
(CIE) coordinates which describe the Office of Hazardous Materials 
Transportation Label and Placard Color Tolerance Charts in tables 1 and 2, and 
the CIE coordinates for the color tolerances specified in table 3. Central 
colors 
and tolerances described in table 2 approximate those described in table 1 while 
allowing for differences in production methods and materials used to manufacture 
labels and placards surfaced with printing inks. Primarily, the color charts 
based on table 1 are for label or placard colors applied as opaque coatings such 
as paint, enamel or plastic, whereas color charts based on table 2 are intended 
for use with labels and placards surfaced only with inks.
For labels printed directly on packaging surfaces, table 3 may be used, although 
compliance with either table 1 or table 2 is sufficient. However, if visual 
reference indicates that the colors of labels printed directly on package 
surfaces are outside the table 1 or 2 tolerances, a spectrophotometer or other 
instrumentation may be required to insure compliance with table 3.

Appendix D to Part 172—Rail Risk Analysis Factors

A. This appendix sets forth the minimum criteria that must be considered by rail 
carriers when performing the safety and security risk analyses required by 
§ 172.820. The risk analysis to be performed may be quantitative, qualitative, 
or a combination of both. In addition to clearly identifying the hazardous 
material(s) and route(s) being analyzed, the analysis must provide a thorough 
description of the threats, identified vulnerabilities, and mitigation measures 
implemented to address identified vulnerabilities.

B. In evaluating the safety and security of hazardous materials transport, 
selection of the route for transportation is critical. For the purpose of rail 
transportation route analysis, as specified in § 172.820(c) and (d), a route may 
include the point where the carrier takes possession of the material and all 
track and railroad facilities up to the point 
where the material is relinquished to another entity. Railroad facilities are 
railroad property including, but not limited to, classification and switching 
yards, storage facilities, and non-private sidings; however, they do not include 
an offeror's facility, private track, private siding, or consignee's facility. 
Each rail carrier must use best efforts to communicate with its shippers, 
consignees, and interlining partners to ensure the safety and security of 
shipments during all stages of transportation.
C. Because of the varying operating environments and interconnected nature of 
the rail system, each carrier must select and document the analysis method/model 
used and identify the routes to be analyzed.

D. The safety and security risk analysis must consider current data and 
information as well as changes that may reasonably be anticipated to occur 
during the analysis year. Factors to be considered in the performance of this 
safety and security risk analysis include:

1. Volume of hazardous material transported;

2. Rail traffic density;

3. Trip length for route;

4. Presence and characteristics of railroad facilities;

5. Track type, class, and maintenance schedule;

6. Track grade and curvature;

7. Presence or absence of signals and train control systems along the route 
(“dark” versus signaled territory);

8. Presence or absence of wayside hazard detectors;

9. Number and types of grade crossings;

10. Single versus double track territory;

11. Frequency and location of track turnouts;

12. Proximity to iconic targets;

13. Environmentally sensitive or significant areas;

14. Population density along the route;

15. Venues along the route (stations, events, places of congregation);

16. Emergency response capability along the route;

17. Areas of high consequence along the route, including high consequence 
targets as defined in § 172.820(c);

18. Presence of passenger traffic along route (shared track);

19. Speed of train operations;

20. Proximity to en-route storage or repair facilities;

21. Known threats, including any non-public threat scenarios provided by the 
Department of Homeland Security or the Department of Transportation for carrier 
use in the development of the route assessment;

22. Measures in place to address apparent safety and security risks;

23. Availability of practicable alternative routes;

24. Past incidents;

25. Overall times in transit;

26. Training and skill level of crews; and

27. Impact on rail network traffic and congestion.

§ 173.5b

Portable and mobile refrigeration systems.

This section authorizes the highway transportation of residual amounts of 
Division 2.2 refrigerant gases or anhydrous ammonia contained in 
non-specification pressure vessels that are components of refrigeration systems, 
which may or may not be permanently mounted to a transport vehicle, used for 
agricultural operations. These refrigeration systems are used at field sites to 
cool (pre-cool) produce before the produce is loaded into trucks or railcars for 
market or used to supplement stationary refrigeration systems during peak 
harvest times. The components of these refrigeration systems are commonly known 
as vacuum tubes, accumulators, refrigeration units, ice makers, pressure 
coolers, or evaporators.
(a) 
General packaging requirements.
Each non-specification pressure vessel must conform to the following:
(1) Each pressure vessel must be designed, manufactured, and maintained in 
accordance with applicable requirements of the ASME Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of 
this subchapter).

(2) Except as authorized in this section, each pressure vessel and associated 
piping must be rated at a maximum allowable work pressure (MAWP) of 250 psig. 
The pressure in these components may not exceed MAWP.

(3) Any part of the piping or pressure vessel separated from another component 
of the refrigeration system by means of a valve, blank flange, or other device 
must be equipped with a pressure relief valve set at MAWP. All lines that must 
be disconnected for transportation purposes must be closed by means of a cap, 
plug or blank flange, and valves at the end of disconnected lines must be 
tightly closed.

(4) The aggregate total volumetric capacity of components within the 
refrigeration system authorized for highway transportation in accordance with 
this section may not exceed 2,500 gallons per vehicle.

(5) Each pressure vessel and associated piping containing anhydrous ammonia must 
conform to the following:

(i) Piping with a diameter of 2 inches or more must conform to ASTM A 53 
Schedule 40 or ASTM A106 Schedule 40 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(ii) Piping with a diameter of less than 2 inches must conform to ASTM A 53 
Schedule 80 or ASTM A 106 Schedule 80 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(iii) The words “Inhalation Hazard” must be marked as required in special 
provision 13 in § 172.102 of this subchapter and, when practicable, within 24 
inches of the placard.

(b) 
Refrigeration systems placed into service prior to June 1, 1991.
(1) For refrigeration systems placed into service prior to June 1, 1991, each 
pressure vessel and associated piping for the condensing line (“high side”) must 
be rated at an MAWP of not less than 250 psig. Each pressure vessel and 
associated piping for the evaporating line (“low side”) must be rated at an MAWP 
of not less than 150 psig, except that each pressure vessel or associated piping 
that will contain refrigerant gas during transportation must be rated at an MAWP 
of not less than 250 psig. During transportation, pressure in the components 
that are part of the evaporating line may not exceed 150 psig.
(2) Each pressure vessel and associated piping that is part of the evaporating 
line must be marked “LOW SIDE” in a permanent and clearly visible manner. The 
evaporating line must have a pressure gauge with corresponding temperature 
markings mounted so as to be easily readable when standing on the ground. The 
gauge must be permanently marked or tagged “SATURATION GAUGE”.

(3) Each pressure vessel and associated piping with an MAWP of 250 psig or 
greater containing liquid anhydrous ammonia must be isolated using appropriate 
means from piping and components marked “LOW SIDE”.

(4) Liquid lading is only authorized in system components with a rated MAWP of 
not less than 250 psig.

(5) Prior to transportation, each pressure vessel and associated piping with a 
rated MAWP of less than 250 psig must be relieved of enough gaseous lading to 
ensure that the MAWP is not exceeded at transport temperatures up to 54 °C (130 
°F).

(6) Refrigeration systems placed into service prior to June 1, 1991, may 
continue in service until October 1, 2017.

(c) Prior to transportation over public highways, each pressure vessel and 
associated piping must be drained of 
refrigerant gas or liquid anhydrous ammonia to the extent practicable. Drained 
contents must be recovered in conformance with all applicable environmental 
regulations. Residual liquid anhydrous ammonia in each component may not exceed 
one percent of the component's total volumetric capacity or 10 gallons, 
whichever is less.
(d) 
System inspection and testing.
(1) Each refrigeration system authorized under this section must be visually 
inspected every year. The visual inspection must include items listed in 
§ 180.407(d)(2) of this subchapter applicable to refrigeration systems. A 
certificate of the annual visual inspection must be dated and signed by the 
person performing the inspection and must contain that person's company 
affiliation. The certificate must remain at the equipment owner's office.
(2) Each refrigeration system authorized under this section must be proof 
pressure tested every two years beginning with the initial pressure test 
performed after manufacture. Additional pressure tests must be performed after 
any modification, repair or damage to a part of the system pressurized with 
refrigerant gas. System test pressures may not be less than one-and-one-half 
(1.50) times the rated MAWP of the system component or piping.

(3) Pressure relief valves must be successfully tested every two years at the 
MAWP for the components or piping to which they are attached. Pressure relief 
valves may be replaced and marked every 5 years with valves certified at the 
appropriate MAWP, in which case the valves need not be tested every two years. 
Valves that do not pass the test must be repaired or replaced.

(e) 
Test markings and reports.
(1) Evidence of testing specified in paragraph (d) of this section must be 
marked on the right forward side of the refrigeration system with 2 inch high 
letters indicating type of last test (V = visual; P = pressure: hydrostatic or 
pneumatic) and the month/year in which it was performed. Reports and all of the 
requirements for records of inspections including markings must be completed as 
specified in part 180.
(2) Pressure relief valves must be durably marked with either the date of last 
test, set-pressure and testing company or the date of last replacement, 
set-pressure, and certifying company, as applicable.

Carriers should give permission for the unloading of these containers on carrier 
tracks only where no private siding is available within reasonable trucking 
distance of final destination. The danger involved is the release of compressed 
gases due to accidental 
damage to container in handling. The exposure to this danger decreases directly 
with the isolation of the unloading point.

(3) Refrigeration may be used as a means of stabilization only when approved by 
the Associate Administrator. Approvals issued by the Bureau of Explosives are no 
longer valid (see § 171.19 of this subchapter). Methods of stabilization 
approved by the Associate Administrator are as follows:

(i) For highway transportation:

(A) A material meeting the criteria of this paragraph (f) may be transported 
only in a transport vehicle, freight container, or motor vehicle equipped with a 
mechanical refrigeration unit, or loaded with a consumable refrigerant, capable 
of maintaining the inside temperature of the hazardous material at or below the 
control temperature required for the material during transportation.

(B) Each package containing a material meeting the criteria of this paragraph 
(f) must be loaded and maintained at or below the control temperature required 
for the material. The temperature of the material must be determined by 
appropriate means and entered on a written record at the time the packaging is 
loaded.

(C) The vehicle operator shall monitor the inside temperature of the transport 
vehicle, freight container, or motor vehicle and enter that temperature on a 
written record at the time the package is loaded and thereafter at intervals not 
exceeding two hours. Alternatively, a transport vehicle, freight container, or 
motor vehicle may be equipped with a visible or audible warning device that 
activates when the inside temperature of the transport vehicle, freight 
container, or motor vehicle exceeds the control temperature required for the 
material. The warning device must be readily visible or audible, as appropriate, 
from the vehicle operator's seat in the vehicle.

(D) The carrier shall advise the vehicle operator of the emergency temperature 
for the material, and provide the vehicle operator with written procedures that 
must be followed to assure maintenance of the control temperature inside the 
transport vehicle, freight container, or motor vehicle. The written procedures 
must include instructions for the vehicle operator on actions to take if the 
inside temperature exceeds the control temperature and approaches or reaches the 
emergency temperature for the material. In addition, the written 
temperature-control procedures must identify enroute points where the consumable 
refrigerant may be procured, or where repairs to, or replacement of, the 
mechanical refrigeration unit may be accomplished.

(E) The vehicle operator shall maintain the written temperature-control 
procedures, and the written record of temperature measurements specified in 
paragraph (f)(3)(i)(C) of this section, if applicable, in the same manner as 
specified in § 177.817 of this subchapter for shipping papers.

(F) If the control temperature is maintained by use of a consumable refrigerant 
(e.g., dry ice or liquid nitrogen), the quantity of consumable refrigerant must 
be sufficient to maintain the control temperature for twice the average transit 
time under normal conditions of transportation.

(G) A material that has a control temperature of 40 °C (104 °F) or higher may be 
transported by common carrier. A material that has a control temperature below 
40 °C (104 °F) must be transported by a private or contract carrier.

(ii) For transportation by vessel, shipments are authorized in accordance with 
the control temperature requirements in 7.3.7 of the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 
of this subchapter).

(g) Packages which give off a flammable gas or vapor, released from a material 
not otherwise subject to this subchapter, likely to create a flammable mixture 
with air in a transport vehicle.

(h) Packages containing materials (other than those classed as explosive) which 
will detonate in a fire.

(1) For purposes of this paragraph, “detonate” means an explosion in which the 
shock wave travels through the material at a speed greater than the speed of 
sound.

(2) When tests are required to evaluate the performance of a package under the 
provisions of this paragraph, the testing must be done or approved by one of the 
agencies specified in § 173.56.

(i) Except for a package containing a lighter design sample that meets the 
requirements of § 173.308(b)(2), a package containing a lighter (see § 171.8 of 
this subchapter) containing a Division 2.1 material, of a design that has not 
been examined and successfully tested by an authorized person under the criteria 
specified in § 173.308(a)(4) or, a lighter design containing a Class 3 material, 
that has not been approved by the Associate Administrator.
(j) An organic peroxide of the “ketone peroxide” category which contains more 
than 9 percent available oxygen as calculated using the equation in 
§ 173.128(a)(4)(ii). The category, ketone peroxide, includes, but is not limited 
to: 


Acetyl acetone peroxide

Cyclohexanone peroxide(s)

Diacetone alcohol peroxides

Methylcyclohexanone peroxide(s)

Methyl ethyl ketone peroxide(s)

Methyl isobutyl ketone peroxide(s)

(k) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, including subpart C 
of part 171 and 175.10(a)(2) of this subchapter, an oxygen generator (chemical) 
as cargo on a passenger-carrying aircraft. This prohibition does not apply to an 
oxygen generator for medical or personal use of a passenger that meets the 
requirements of § 175.10(a)(7) of this subchapter.

§ 173.24

General requirements for packagings and packages.

(a) 
Applicability.
Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the provisions of this section 
apply to—
(1) Bulk and non-bulk packagings;

(2) New packagings and packagings which are reused; and

(3) Specification and non-specification packagings.

(b) Each package used for the shipment of hazardous materials under this 
subchapter shall be designed, constructed, maintained, filled, its contents so 
limited, and closed, so that under conditions normally incident to 
transportation—

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, there will be no 
identifiable (without the use of instruments) release of hazardous materials to 
the environment;

(2) The effectiveness of the package will not be substantially reduced; for 
example, impact resistance, strength, packaging compatibility, etc. must be 
maintained for the minimum and maximum temperatures, changes in humidity and 
pressure, and shocks, loadings and vibrations, normally encountered during 
transportation;

(3) There will be no mixture of gases or vapors in the package which could, 
through any credible spontaneous increase of heat or pressure, significantly 
reduce the effectiveness of the packaging;

(4) There will be no hazardous material residue adhering to the outside of the 
package during transport.

(c) 
Authorized packagings.
(1) A packaging is authorized for a hazardous material only if—
(i) The packaging is prescribed or permitted for the hazardous material in a 
packaging section specified for that material in Column 8 of the § 172.101 table 
and conforms to applicable requirements in the special provisions of Column 7 of 
the § 172.101 table 
and, for specification packagings (but not including UN standard packagings 
manufactured outside the United States), the specification requirements in parts 
178 and 179 of this subchapter; or
(ii) The packaging is permitted under, and conforms to, provisions contained in 
subparts B or C of part 171 of this subchapter or § 173.3, § 173.4, § 173.4a,

Specification packagings and UN standard packagings manufactured outside the 
U.S.
—(1) 
Specification packagings.
A specification packaging, including a UN standard packaging manufactured in the 
United States, must conform in all details to the applicable specification or 
standard in part 178 or part 179 of this subchapter.
(2) UN standard packagings manufactured outside the United States. A UN standard 
packaging manufactured outside the United States, in accordance with national or 
international regulations based on the UN Recommendations (IBR, see § 171.7 of 
this subchapter), may be imported and used and is considered to be an authorized 
packaging under the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this section, subject to 
the following conditions and limitations:

(i) The packaging fully conforms to applicable provisions in the UN 
Recommendations and the requirements of this subpart, including reuse 
provisions;

(ii) The packaging is capable of passing the prescribed tests in part 178 of 
this subchapter applicable to that standard; and

(iii) The competent authority of the country of manufacture provides reciprocal 
treatment for UN standard packagings manufactured in the U.S.

(e) 
Compatibility.
(1) Even though certain packagings are specified in this part, it is, 
nevertheless, the responsibility of the person offering a hazardous material for 
transportation to ensure that such packagings are compatible with their lading. 
This particularly applies to corrosivity, permeability, softening, premature 
aging and embrittlement.
(2) Packaging materials and contents must be such that there will be no 
significant chemical or galvanic reaction between the materials and contents of 
the package.

(3) 
Plastic packagings and receptacles.
(i) Plastic used in packagings and receptacles must be of a type compatible with 
the lading and may not be permeable to an extent that a hazardous condition is 
likely to occur during transportation, handling or refilling.
(ii) Each plastic packaging or receptacle which is used for liquid hazardous 
materials must be capable of withstanding without failure the procedure 
specified in appendix B of this part (“Procedure for Testing Chemical 
Compatibility and Rate of Permeation in Plastic Packagings and Receptacles”). 
The procedure specified in appendix B of this part must be performed on each 
plastic packaging or receptacle used for Packing Group I materials. The maximum 
rate of permeation of hazardous lading through or into the plastic packaging or 
receptacles may not exceed 0.5 percent for materials meeting the definition of a 
Division 6.1 material according to § 173.132 and 2.0 percent for other hazardous 
materials, when subjected to a temperature no lower than—

(A) 18 °C (64 °F) for 180 days in accordance with Test Method 1 in appendix B of 
this part;

(B) 50 °C (122 °F) for 28 days in accordance with Test Method 2 in appendix B of 
this part; or

(C) 60 °C (140 °F) for 14 days in accordance with Test Method 3 in appendix B of 
this part.

(iii) Alternative procedures or rates of permeation are permitted if they yield 
a level of safety equivalent to or greater than that provided by paragraph 
(e)(3)(ii) of this section and are specifically approved by the Associate 
Administrator.

(4) 
Mixed contents.
Hazardous materials may not be packed or mixed together in the same outer 
packaging with other hazardous or nonhazardous materials if such materials are 
capable of reacting dangerously with each other and causing—
(i) Combustion or dangerous evolution of heat;

(ii) Evolution of flammable, poisonous, or asphyxiant gases; or

(iii) Formation of unstable or corrosive materials.

(5) Packagings used for solids, which may become liquid at temperatures likely 
to be encountered during transportation, must be capable of containing the 
hazardous material in the liquid state.

(f) 
Closures.
(1) Closures on packagings shall be so designed and closed that under conditions 
(including the effects of temperature, pressure and vibration) normally incident 
to transportation—
(i) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, there is no 
identifiable release of hazardous materials to the environment from the opening 
to which the closure is applied; and

(ii) The closure is leakproof and secured against loosening. For air transport, 
stoppers, corks or other such friction closures must be held in place by 
positive means.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, a closure (including 
gaskets or other closure components, if any) used on a specification packaging 
must conform to all applicable requirements of the specification and must be 
closed in accordance with information, as applicable, provided by the 
manufacturer's notification required by § 178.2 of this subchapter.

(g) 
Venting.
Venting of packagings, to reduce internal pressure which may develop by the 
evolution of gas from the contents, is permitted only when—
(1) Except for shipments of cryogenic liquids as specified in § 173.320(c) and 
of carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice), transportation by aircraft is not involved;

(2) Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, the evolved gases are not 
poisonous, likely to create a flammable mixture with air or be an asphyxiant 
under normal conditions of transportation;

(3) The packaging is designed so as to preclude an unintentional release of 
hazardous materials from the receptacle;

(4) For bulk packagings, other than IBCs, venting is authorized for the specific 
hazardous material by a special provision in the § 172.101 table or by the 
applicable bulk packaging specification in part 178 of this subchapter; and

(5) Intermediate bulk packagings (IBCs) may be vented when required to reduce 
internal pressure that may develop by the evolution of gas subject to the 
requirements of paragraphs (g)(1) through (g)(3) of this section. The IBC must 
be of a type that has successfully passed (with the vent in place) the 
applicable design qualification tests with no release of hazardous material.

(h) 
Outage and filling limits
—(1) 
General.
When filling packagings and receptacles for liquids, sufficient ullage (outage) 
must be left to ensure that neither leakage nor permanent distortion of the 
packaging or receptacle will occur as a result of an expansion of the liquid 
caused by temperatures likely to be encountered during transportation. 
Requirements for outage and filling limits for non-bulk and bulk packagings are 
specified in §§ 173.24a(d) and 173.24b(a), respectively.
(2) 
Compressed gases and cryogenic liquids.
Filling limits for compressed gases and cryogenic liquids are specified in 
§§ 173.301 through 173.306 for cylinders and §§ 173.314 through 173.319 for bulk 
packagings.
(i) 
Air transportation.
Except as provided in subpart C of part 171 of this subchapter, packages 
prepared under § 173.167 of this part, or packages prepared under Packing 
Instruction Y963 of the ICAO Technical Instructions, packages offered or 
intended for transportation by aircraft must conform to the general requirements 
for transportation by aircraft in § 173.27.

[Amdt. 173-224, 55 FR 52612, Dec. 21, 1990]


§ 173.27

General requirements for transportation by aircraft.

(a) The requirements of this section are in addition to requirements prescribed 
elsewhere under this part and apply to packages offered or intended for 
transportation aboard aircraft. Except for materials not subject to performance 
packaging requirements in subpart E of this part, a packaging containing a 
Packing Group III material with a primary or subsidiary risk of Division 4.1, 
4.2, 4.3, 5.1, or Class 8 must meet the Packing Group II performance level when 
offered for transportation by aircraft.

(b) 
Packages authorized onboard aircraft.
(1) When Column 9a of the § 172.101 table indicates that a material is 
“Forbidden”, that material may not be offered for transportation or transported 
aboard passenger-carrying aircraft.
(2) When Column 9b of the § 172.101 table indicates that a material is 
“Forbidden”, that material may not be offered for transportation or transported 
aboard aircraft.

(3) The maximum quantity of hazardous material in a package that may be offered 
for transportation or transported aboard a passenger-carrying aircraft or cargo 
aircraft may not exceed that quantity prescribed for the material in Column 9a 
or 9b, respectively, of the § 172.101 table.

(4) A package containing a hazardous material which is authorized aboard cargo 
aircraft but not aboard passenger aircraft must be labeled with the CARGO 
AIRCRAFT ONLY label required by § 172.402(c) of this subchapter and may not be 
offered for transportation or transported aboard passenger-carrying aircraft.

(c) 
Pressure requirements.
(1) Packagings must be designed and constructed to prevent leakage that may be 
caused by changes in altitude and temperature during transportation aboard 
aircraft.
(2) Packagings for which retention of liquid is a basic function must be capable 
of withstanding without leakage the greater of—

(i) An internal pressure which produces a gauge pressure of not less than 75 kPa 
(11 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 or Division 6.1; or 95 kPa 
(14 psig) for other liquids; or

(ii) A pressure related to the vapor pressure of the liquid to be conveyed, 
determined by one of the following:

(A) The total gauge pressure measured in the receptacle (i.e., the vapor 
pressure of the material and the partial pressure of air or other inert gases, 
less 100 kPa (15 psia)) at 55 °C (131 °F), multiplied by a safety factor of 1.5; 
determined on the basis of a filling temperature of 15 °C (59 °F) and a degree 
of filling such that the receptacle is not completely liquid full at a 
temperature of 55 °C (131 °F) or less;

(B) 1.75 times the vapor pressure at 50 °C (122 °F) less 100 kPa (15 psia); or

(C) 1.5 times the vapor pressure at 55 °C (131 °) less 100 kPa (15 psia).

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section—

(i) Hazardous materials may be contained in an inner packaging which does not 
itself meet the pressure requirement provided that the inner packaging is packed 
within a supplementary packaging which does meet the pressure requirement and 
other applicable packaging requirements of this subchapter.

(ii) Packagings which are subject to the hydrostatic pressure test and marking 
requirements of §§ 178.605 and 178.503(a)(5), respectively, of this subchapter 
must have a marked test pressure of not less than 250 kPa (36 psig) for liquids 
in Packing Group I, 80 kPa (12 psig) for liquids in Packing Group III of Class 3 
or Division 6.1, and 100 kPa (15 psig) for other liquids.

(d) 
Closures.
The body and closure of any packaging must be constructed to be able to 
adequately resist the effects of temperature and vibration occurring in 
conditions normally incident to air transportation. Inner packaging or 
receptacle closures of combination packages containing liquids must be held 
securely, tightly and effectively in place by secondary means. Examples of such 
secondary methods include: Adhesive tape, friction sleeves, welding or 
soldering, locking wires, locking rings, induction heat seals, and 
child-resistant closures. The closure device must be designed so that it is 
unlikely that it can be incorrectly or incompletely closed. Closures must be as 
follows:
(1) 
Packing Group I.
An inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Group I must have a secondary 
means of closure applied and packed in accordance with paragraph (e) of this 
section.
(2) 
Packing Groups II and III.
When a secondary means of closure cannot be applied or is impracticable to apply 
to an inner packaging containing liquids of Packing Groups II and III, this 
requirement may be satisfied by securely closing the inner packaging and placing 
it in a leakproof liner or bag before placing the inner packaging in its outer 
packaging.
(e) 
Absorbent materials.
Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, Packing Group I liquid 
hazardous materials of Classes 3, 4, or 8, or Divisions 5.1 or 6.1 that are 
packaged in combination packagings and offered for air transport in glass, 
earthenware, plastic, or metal inner packagings must be packed using absorbent 
material as follows:
(1) Inner packagings must be packed in a rigid and leakproof receptacle or 
intermediate packaging containing sufficient absorbent material to absorb the 
entire contents of the inner packaging before packing the inner packaging in its 
outer package.

(2) Absorbent material must not react dangerously with the liquid (see §§ 173.24 
and 173.24a.).

(f) 
Combination packagings
—(1) 
Excepted quantities.
For authorized materials and inner and outer package quantity limits for 
combination packages of 
excepted quantities
intended for transportation by aircraft, 
see
§ 173.4a of this part. Unless otherwise specified in this part, or in Subpart C 
of part 171 of this subchapter, when combination packagings are intended for 
transportation aboard an aircraft, inner packagings must conform to the quantity 
limitations set forth in table 1 of this paragraph for transport aboard 
passenger-carrying aircraft and table 2 of this paragraph for transport aboard 
cargo-only aircraft.
(2) 
Limited quantities.
(i) Unless otherwise specified in this part, or in subpart C of part 171 of this 
subchapter, when a limited quantity of hazardous material packaged in a 
combination packaging is intended for transportation aboard an aircraft, the 
inner and outer packagings must conform to the quantity limitations set forth in 
Table 3 of this paragraph (f). Materials and articles must be authorized for 
transportation aboard a passenger-carrying aircraft (see Column (9A) of the 
§ 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table of this subchapter). Not all unauthorized 
materials or articles may be indicated in this table. For mixed content packages 
of limited quantity material, the total net quantity must not exceed the lowest 
permitted maximum net quantity (for each of the hazard classes or divisions 
represented in the package) per outer package set forth in Table 3 of this 
paragraph (f). The permitted maximum net quantity must be calculated in 
kilograms for a package that contains both a solid and a liquid. Unless 
otherwise excepted, packages must be marked and labeled in accordance with this 
section and any additional requirements in subparts D and E, respectively, of 
part 172 of this subchapter. Materials or articles not authorized as limited 
quantity by aircraft are:
(A) Those in Packing Group I;

(B) Class 1 (explosive) material (see § 173.63(b) of this part for exceptions 
provided to certain articles of Division 1.4S) and Class 7 (radioactive) 
material (see §§ 173.421 through 173.425 of this part, as applicable, for 
exceptions provided to certain substances, instruments or articles of Class 7);

(C) Divisions 2.1 (flammable gas) (
except
Aerosols (UN1950) and Receptacles, small (UN2037) without subsidiary risk) and 
Division 2.3 (toxic gas);
(D) Divisions 4.1 (self-reactive), 4.2 (spontaneously combustible) (primary or 
subsidiary risk), and 4.3 (dangerous when wet) (liquids);

(E) Division 5.2 (organic peroxide) (
except
when contained in a Chemical or First aid kit (UN3316) or Polyester 
resin kit (UN3269) (Types D, E and F non-temperature controlled only));
(F) Class 8 (corrosive) materials UN2794, UN2795, UN2803, UN2809, UN3028, 
UN3506; and

(G) All Class 9 (miscellaneous) materials 
except for
UN1941, UN1990, UN2071, UN3077, UN3082, UN3316, UN3334, UN3335, and ID8000.
(ii) Effective January 1, 2012, packages must be marked with the limited 
quantity “Y” mark as prescribed in § 172.315 of this part when conforming to 
Table 3 of this paragraph. Until December 31, 2012, a package may instead be 
marked with the proper shipping name “Consumer commodity” and “ORM-D-AIR” 
(including “Charcoal, NA1361) if it contains a consumer commodity, as authorized 
by this subchapter in effect on October 1, 2010.

(iii) Strong outer packagings are required and a completed package may not 
exceed 30 kg (66 lbs) gross weight.

(iv) A secondary means of closure required for all liquids contained in inner 
packagings. If this requirement cannot be satisfied, the use of an intermediate 
and leakproof form of containment, such as a liner, is required.

(v) Packages must be capable of passing a 1.2 m drop test on to a rigid, 
non-resilient, flat and horizontal surface, in the position most likely to cause 
damage. The criteria for passing the test is that the outer packaging must not 
exhibit any damage affecting safety in transport and there must be no leakage 
from the inner packagings.

(vi) Each package must be capable of withstanding, without breakage or leakage 
of any inner packaging, a force applied to the top surface for a duration of 24 
hours equivalent to the total weight of identical packages if stacked to a 
height of 3 m (including the test sample).

(vii) Except for UN3082, inner packagings of combination packagings containing 
liquids must be capable of passing the appropriate pressure differential test 
prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

= guaranteed minimum elongation (as a percentage) of the metal to be used on 
fracture under tensile stress (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).
(5) Plastic inner receptacles of composite packagings must have a minimum 
thickness of 1.0 mm (0.039 inch).

(6) A previously used non-bulk packaging may be reused for the shipment of 
hazardous waste, not subject to the reconditioning and reuse provisions of this 
section, in accordance with § 173.12(c).

(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, a 
packaging otherwise authorized for reuse may be reused without being 
leakproofness tested with air provided the packaging—

(i) Is refilled with a material which is compatible with the previous lading:

(ii) Is refilled and offered for transportation by the original filler;

(iii) Is transported in a transport vehicle or freight container under the 
exclusive use of the refiller of the packaging; and

(iv) Is constructed of—

(A) Stainless steel, monel or nickel with a thickness not less than one and 
one-half times the minimum thickness prescribed in paragraph (b)(4) of this 
section;

(B) Plastic, provided the packaging is not refilled for reuse on a date more 
than five years from the date of manufacture marked on the packaging in 
accordance with § 178.503(a)(6) of this subchapter; or

(C) Another material or thickness when approved under the conditions established 
by the Associate Administrator for reuse without retesting.

(c) 
Reconditioning of non-bulk packaging.
(1) For the purpose of this subchapter, reconditioning of metal drums is:
(i) Cleaning to base material of construction, with all former contents, 
internal and external corrosion, and any external coatings and labels removed;

(ii) Restoring to original shape and contour, with chimes (if any) straightened 
and sealed, and all non-integral gaskets replaced: and

(iii) Inspecting after cleaning but before painting, Packagings that have 
visible pitting, significant reduction in material thickness, metal fatigue, 
damaged threads or closures, or other significant defects, must be rejected.

(2) For the purpose of this subchapter, reconditioning of a non-bulk packaging 
other than a metal drum includes:

(i) Removal of all former contents, external coatings and labels, and cleaning 
to the original materials of construction;

(ii) Inspection after cleaning with rejection of packagings with visible damage 
such as tears, creases or cracks, or damaged threads or closures, or other 
significant defects;

(iii) Replacement of all non-integral gaskets and closure devices with new or 
refurbished parts, and cushioning and cushioning materials; and components 
including gaskets, closure devices and cushioning and cushioning material. (For 
a UN 1H1 plastic drum, replacing a removable gasket or closure device with 
another of the same design and material that provides equivalent performance 
does not constitute reconditioning); and

(iv) Ensuring that the packagings are restored to a condition that conforms in 
all respects with the prescribed requirements of this subchapter.

(3) A person who reconditions a packaging manufactured and marked under the 
provisions of subpart L of part 178 of this subchapter, shall mark that 
packaging as required by § 178.503(c) and (d) of this subchapter. The marking is 
the certification of the reconditioner that the packaging conforms to the 
standard for which it is marked and that all functions performed by the 
reconditioner which are prescribed by this subchapter have been performed in 
compliance with this subchapter.

(4) The markings applied by the reconditioner may be different from those 
applied by the manufacturer at the time of original manufacture, but may not 
identify a greater performance capability than that for which the original 
design type had been tested (for example, the reconditioner may mark a drum 
which was originally marked as 1A1/Y1.8 as 1A1/Y1.2 or 1A1/Z2.0).

(5) Packagings which have significant defects which cannot be repaired may not 
be reused.

(d) 
Remanufacture of non-bulk packagings.
For the purpose of this subchapter, remanufacture is the conversion of a 
non-specification, non-bulk packaging to a DOT specification or U.N. standard, 
the conversion of a packaging meeting one specification or standard to another 
specification or standard (for example, conversion of 1A1 non-removable head 
drums to 1A2 removable head drums) or the replacement of integral structural 
packaging components (such as non-removable heads on drums). A person who 
remanufactures a non-bulk packaging to conform to a specification or standard in 
part 178 of this subchapter is subject to the requirements of part 178 of this 
subchapter as a manufacturer.
(e) 
Non-reusable containers.
A packaging marked as NRC according to the DOT specification or UN standard 
requirements of part 178 of this subchapter may be reused for the shipment of 
any material not required by this subchapter to be shipped in a DOT 
specification or UN standard packaging.
(f) A Division 6.2 packaging to be reused must be disinfected prior to reuse by 
any means effective for neutralizing the infectious substance the packaging 
previously contained. A secondary packaging or outer packaging conforming to the 
requirements of § 173.196 or § 173.199 need not be disinfected prior to reuse if 
no leakage from the primary receptacle has occurred. Drums or jerricans not 
meeting the minimum thickness requirements prescribed in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of 
this section may not be reused or reconditioned for reuse.

protection; the number of new or different tank cars acquired to replace those 
tank cars required to be upgraded to a higher service pressure; and the total 
number of tank cars modified, reassigned, acquired, retired, or removed from 
service the previous year.
(c) 
Tank car test pressure.
A tank car used for the transportation of a hazardous material must have a tank 
test pressure equal to or greater than the greatest of the following:
(1) Except for shipments of carbon dioxide, anhydrous hydrogen chloride, vinyl 
fluoride, ethylene, or hydrogen, 133 percent of the sum of lading vapor pressure 
at the reference temperature of 46 °C (115 °F) for non-insulated tank cars or 41 
°C (105 °F) for insulated tank cars plus static head, plus gas padding pressure 
in the vacant space of a tank car;

(2) 133 percent of the maximum loading or unloading pressure, whichever is 
greater;

(3) 20.7 Bar (300 psig) for materials that are poisonous by inhalation (see 
§ 173.31(e)(2)(ii) for compliance dates);

(4) The minimum pressure prescribed by the specification in part 179 of this 
subchapter; or

(5) The minimum test pressure prescribed for the specific hazardous material in 
the applicable packaging section in subpart F or G of this part.

(d) 
Examination before shipping.
(1) No person may offer for transportation a tank car containing a hazardous 
material or a residue of a hazardous material unless that person determines that 
the tank car is in proper condition and safe for transportation. As a minimum, 
each person offering a tank car for transportation must perform an external 
visual inspection that includes:
(i) Except where insulation or a thermal protection system precludes an 
inspection, the tank shell and heads for abrasion, corrosion, cracks, dents, 
distortions, defects in welds, or any other condition that makes the tank car 
unsafe for transportation;

(ii) The piping, valves, fittings, and gaskets for corrosion, damage, or any 
other condition that makes the tank car unsafe for transportation;

(iii) For missing or loose bolts, nuts, or elements that make the tank car 
unsafe for transportation;

(iv) All closures on tank cars and determine that the closures and all 
fastenings securing them are properly tightened in place by the use of a bar, 
wrench, or other suitable tool;

(v) Protective housings for proper securement;

(vi) The pressure relief device, including a careful inspection of the rupture 
disc in non-reclosing pressure relief devices, for corrosion or damage that may 
alter the intended operation of the device. The rupture disc is not required to 
be removed prior to visual inspection if the tank car contains the residue, as 
defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter, of a Class 8, PG II or PG III material 
with no subsidiary hazard or the residue of a Class 9 elevated temperature 
material;

(vii) Each tell-tale indicator after filling and prior to transportation to 
ensure the integrity of the rupture disc;

(viii) The external thermal protection system, tank-head puncture resistance 
system, coupler vertical restraint system, and bottom discontinuity protection 
for conditions that make the tank car unsafe for transportation;

(ix) The required markings on the tank car for legibility; and

(x) The periodic inspection date markings to ensure that the inspection and test 
intervals are within the prescribed intervals.

(2) Closures on tank cars are required, in accordance with this subchapter, to 
be designed and closed so that under conditions normally incident to 
transportation, including the effects of temperature and vibration, there will 
be no identifiable release of a hazardous material to the environment. ln any 
action brought to enforce this section, the lack of securement of any closure to 
a tool-tight condition, detected at any point, will establish a rebuttable 
presumption that a proper inspection was not performed by the offeror of the 
car. That presumption may be rebutted by any evidence indicating that the lack 
of securement resulted from a specific cause not within the control of the 
offeror.

(e) 
Special requirements for materials poisonous by inhalation
—(1) 
Interior heater coils.
Tank cars used for materials poisonous by inhalation may not have interior 
heater coils.
(2) Tank car specifications. A tank car used for a material poisonous by 
inhalation must have a tank test pressure of 20.7 Bar (300 psig) or greater, 
head protection, and a metal jacket (e.g., DOT 105S300W), except that—

(i) A higher test pressure is required if otherwise specified in this 
subchapter; and

(ii) Each tank car constructed on or after March 16, 2009, and used for the 
transportation of PIH materials must meet the applicable authorized tank car 
specifications and standards listed in § 173.244(a)(2) or (3) and § 173.314(c) 
or (d).

(iii) A tank car meeting the applicable authorized tank car specifications 
listed in § 173.244(a)(2) or (3), or § 173.314(c) or (d) is authorized for the 
transportation of a material poisonous by inhalation for a period of 20 years 
after the date of original construction.

(iv) A tank car owner retiring or otherwise removing a tank car from service 
transporting materials poisonous by inhalation, other than because of damage to 
the car, must retire or remove cars constructed of non-normalized steel in the 
head or shell before removing any car in service transporting materials 
poisonous by inhalation constructed of normalized steel meeting the applicable 
DOT specification.

(f) 
Special requirements for hazardous substances.
(1) A tank car used for a hazardous substance listed in paragraph (f)(2) of this 
section must have a tank test pressure of at least 13.8 Bar (200 psig), head 
protection and a metal jacket, except that—
(i) No metal jacket is required if—

(A) The tank test pressure is 23.4 Bar (340 psig) or higher; or

(B) The tank shell and heads are manufactured from AAR steel specification 
TC-128, normalized;

(ii) A higher test pressure is required if otherwise specified in this 
subchapter; and

(iii) Other than as provided in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, a tank car 
which does not conform to the requirements of this paragraph (f)(1), and was 
authorized for a hazardous substance under the regulations in effect on June 30,

§ 173.32

Requirements for the use of portable tanks.

(a) 
General requirements.
No person may offer a hazardous material for transportation in a portable tank 
except as authorized by this subchapter.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, no person may use a portable 
tank for the transportation of a hazardous material unless it meets the 
requirements of this subchapter.

(2) No person may fill and offer for transportation a portable tank when the 
prescribed periodic test or inspection under subpart G of part 180 of this 
subchapter has become due until the test or inspection has been successfully 
completed. This requirement does not apply to any portable tank filled prior to 
the test or inspection due date.

(3) When a portable tank is used as a cargo tank motor vehicle, it must conform 
to all the requirements prescribed for cargo tank motor vehicles. (See 
§ 173.33.)

(b) 
Substitute packagings.
A particular Specification portable tank may be substituted for another portable 
tank as follows:
(1) An IM or UN portable tank may be used whenever an IM or UN portable tank 
having less stringent requirements is authorized provided the portable tank 
meets or exceeds the requirements for pressure-relief devices, bottom outlets 
and any other special provisions specified in § 172.102(c)(7)(vi) of this 
subchapter.

(2) Where a Specification IM101 or IM102 portable tank is prescribed, a UN 
portable tank or Specification 51 portable tank otherwise conforming to the 
special commodity requirements of § 172.102(c)(7) of this subchapter for the 
material to be transported may be used.

(3) A DOT Specification 51 portable tank may be used whenever a DOT 
Specification 56, 57, or 60 portable tank is authorized. A DOT Specification 60 
portable tank may be used whenever a DOT Specification 56 or 57 portable tank is 
authorized. A higher integrity tank used instead of a specified portable tank 
must meet the same design profile; for example, a DOT Specification 51 portable 
tank must be lined if used instead of a lined DOT Specification 60 portable 
tank.

(4) A portable tank authorized by the Transport Canada TDG Regulations (IBR, see 
§ 171.7 of this subchapter) may be used provided it conforms to the applicable 
requirements in § 171.12 of this subchapter.

(c)

—(1) 
Continued use of Specification 56 and 57 portable tanks.
Continued use of an existing portable tank constructed to DOT Specification 56 
or 57 is authorized only for a portable tank constructed before October 1, 1996. 
A stainless steel portable tank internally lined with polyethylene that was 
constructed on or before October 1, 1996, and that meets all requirements of DOT 
Specification 57 except for being equipped with a polypropylene discharge ball 
valve and polypropylene secondary discharge opening closure, may be marked as a 
Specification 57 portable tank and used in accordance with the provisions of 
this section.
(2) A DOT Specification 51, IM 101, or IM 102 portable tank may not be 
manufactured after January 1, 2003; however, such tanks may continue to be used 
for the transportation of a hazardous material provided they meet the 
requirements of this subchapter, including the specification requirements and 
the requirements of this subchapter for the transportation of the particular 
hazardous material according to the T codes in effect on September 30, 2001 or 
the new T codes in § 172.102(c)(7)(i), and provided the portable tanks conform 
to the periodic inspection and tests specified for the particular portable tank 
in subpart G of part 180 of this subchapter. After January 1, 2003, all newly 
manufactured portable tanks must conform to the requirements for the design, 
construction and approval of UN portable tanks as specified in §§ 178.273, 
178.274, 178.275, 178.276, 178.277 and part 180, subpart G, of this subchapter.

(3) A DOT Specification portable tank manufactured prior to January 1, 1992 that 
is equipped with a non-reclosing pressure relief device may continue in service 
for the hazardous materials for which it is authorized. Except for a DOT 
Specification 56 or 57 portable tank, a DOT Specification portable tank 
manufactured after January 1, 1992, used for materials meeting the definition 
for Division 6.1 liquids, Packing Group I or II, Class 2 gases, or Class 3 or 4 
liquids, must be equipped with a reclosing pressure relief valve having 
adequately sized venting capacity unless otherwise specified in this subchapter 
(see §§ 178.275(f)(1) and 178.277 of this subchapter).

(4) Any portable tank container constructed prior to May 15, 1950, complying 
with the requirements of either the ASME Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels, 1946 
Edition, or the API ASME Code for Unfired Pressure Vessels, 1943 Edition, may be 
used for the transportation of liquefied compressed gas, provided it fulfills 
all the requirements of the part and specifications for the particular gas or 
gases to be transported. Such portable tanks must be marked “ICC Specification 
51X” on the plate required by the specification, except as modified by any or 
all of the following:

(i) Portable tanks designed and constructed in accordance with Pars. U-68, U-69, 
or U-201 of the ASME Code, 1943 and 1946 editions, may be used. Portable tanks 
designed and constructed in accordance with Par. U-68 or Par. U-69 may be 
re-rated at a working pressure 25 percent in excess of the design pressure for 
which the portable tank was originally constructed. If the portable tank is 
re-rated, the re-rated pressure must be marked on the plate as follows: 
“Re-rated working pressure—psig”.

(ii) Loading and unloading accessories, valves, piping, fittings, safety and 
gauging devices, do not have to comply with the requirements for the particular 
location on the portable tank.

(5) Any ICC Specification 50 portable tank fulfilling the requirements of that 
specification may be continued in service for transportation of a liquefied 
petroleum gas if it is retested every five years in accordance with the 
requirements in § 180.605 of this subchapter. Use of existing portable tanks is 
authorized. New construction is not authorized.
(d) 
Determination of an authorized portable tank.
Prior to filling and offering a portable tank for transportation, the shipper 
must ensure that the portable tank conforms to the authorized specification and 
meets the applicable requirements in this subchapter for the hazardous material. 
The shipper must ensure that the MAWP, design pressure or test pressure of the 
portable tank, as applicable, is appropriate for the hazardous material being 
transported. Determination of the applicable pressure must take into account the 
maximum pressure used to load or unload the hazardous material, the vapor 
pressure, static head and surge pressures of the hazardous material and the 
temperatures that the hazardous material will experience during transportation.
(e) 
External inspection prior to filling.
Each portable tank must be given a complete external inspection prior to 
filling. Any unsafe condition must be corrected prior to its being filled and 
offered for transportation. The external inspection shall include a visual 
inspection of:
(1) The shell, piping, valves and other appurtenances for corroded areas, dents, 
defects in welds and other defects such as missing, damaged, or leaking gaskets;

(2) All flanged connections or blank flanges for missing or loose nuts and 
bolts;

(3) All emergency devices for corrosion, distortion, or any damage or defect 
that could prevent their normal operation;

(4) All required markings on the tank for legibility; and

(5) Any device for tightening manhole covers to ensure such devices are 
operative and adequate to prevent leakage at the manhole cover.

(f) 
Loading requirements.

pressure greater than its marked maximum allowable working pressure or, when 
appropriate, its marked design pressure.

(4) A portable tank may not be loaded to a gross mass greater than the maximum 
allowable gross mass specified on its identification plate.

(5) Except for a non-flowable solid or a liquid with a viscosity of 2,680 
centistokes (millimeters squared per second) or greater at 20 °C (68 °F), an IM 
or UN portable tank, or compartment thereof, having a volume greater than 7,500 
L (1,980 gallons) may not be loaded to a filling density of more than 20% and 
less than 80% by volume. This filling restriction does not apply if a portable 
tank is divided by partitions or surge plates into compartments of not more than 
7,500 L (1,980 gallons) capacity; this portable tank must not be offered for 
transportation in an ullage condition liable to produce an unacceptable 
hydraulic force due to surge.

(6) The outage for a portable tank may not be less than 2% at a temperature of 
50 °C (122 °F) unless otherwise specified in this subchapter. For UN portable 
tanks, the applicable maximum filling limits apply as specified according to the

when transported domestically.

(7) Each tell-tale indicator or pressure gauge located in the space between a 
frangible disc and a safety relief valve mounted in series must be checked after 
the tank is filled and prior to transportation to ensure that the frangible disc 
is leak free. Any leakage through the frangible disc must be corrected prior to 
offering the tank for transportation.

(8) During filling, the temperature of the hazardous materials shall not exceed 
the limits of the design temperature range of the portable tank.

(9) The maximum mass of liquefied compressed gas per liter (gallon) of shell 
capacity (kg/L or lbs./gal.) may not exceed the density of the liquefied 
compressed gas at 50 °C (122 °F). The portable tank must not be liquid full at 
60 °C (140 °F).

(g) 
Additional requirements for specific modal transport.
In addition to other applicable requirements, the following apply:
(1) A portable tank containing a hazardous material may not be loaded onto a 
highway or rail transport vehicle unless loaded entirely within the horizontal 
outline of the vehicle, without overhang or projection of any part of the tank 
assembly.

(2) An IM or UN portable tank used for the transportation of flammable liquids 
by rail may not be fitted with non-reclosing pressure relief devices except in 
series with reclosing pressure relief valves.

(3) A portable tank or Specification 106A or 110A multi-unit tank car containing 
a hazardous material may not be offered for transportation aboard a passenger 
vessel unless:

(i) The vessel is operating under a change to its character of vessel 
certification as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter; and

(ii) The material is permitted to be transported aboard a passenger vessel in 
the § 172.101 Table of this subchapter.

(h) 
Additional general commodity-specific requirements.
In addition to other applicable requirements, the following requirements apply:
(1) Each uninsulated portable tank used for the transportation of a liquefied 
compressed gas must have an exterior surface finish that is significantly 
reflective, such as a light-reflecting color if painted, or a bright reflective 
metal or other material if unpainted.

(2) If a hazardous material is being transported in a molten state, the portable 
tank must be thermally insulated with suitable insulation material of sufficient 
thickness that the overall thermal conductance is not more than 0.080 Btu per 
hour per square foot per degree Fahrenheit differential.

(3) No person may offer a liquid hazardous material of Class 3, PG I or II, or 
PG III with a flash point of less than 100 °F (38 °C); Division 5.1, PG I or II; 
or Division 6.1, PG I or II, in an IM or UN portable tank that is equipped with 
a bottom outlet as authorized in Column (7) of the § 172.101 Table of this 
subchapter by assignment of a T Code in the appropriate proper shipping name 
entry, for unloading to a facility while it remains on a transport vehicle with 
the power unit attached unless—

(i) The tank outlets conform to § 178.275(d)(3) of this subchapter; or

(ii) The facility at which the IM or UN portable tank is to be unloaded conforms 
to the requirements in § 177.834(o) of this subchapter.

(i) 
Additional requirements for portable tanks other than IM specification and UN 
portable tanks.
(1) The bursting strength of any piping and fittings must be at least four times 
the design pressure of the tank, and at least four times the pressure to which, 
in any instance, it may be subjected in service by the action of a pump or other 
device (not including safety relief valves) that may subject piping to pressures 
greater than the design pressure of the tank.
(2) Pipe joints must be threaded, welded or flanged. If threaded pipe is used, 
the pipe and pipe fittings must not be lighter than Schedule 80 weight. Where 
copper tubing is permitted, joints must be brazed or be of equally strong metal 
union type. The melting point of brazing material may not be lower than 1,000 °F 
(537.8 °C). The method of joining tubing must not decrease the strength of the 
tubing such as by the cutting of threads.

(3) Non-malleable metals may not be used in the construction of valves or 
fittings.

(4) Suitable provision must be made in every case to allow for expansion, 
contraction, jarring and vibration of all pipe. Slip joints may not be used for 
this purpose.

(5) Piping and fittings must be grouped in the smallest practicable space and 
must be protected from damage as required by the specification.

(6) All piping, valves and fittings on every portable tank must be leakage 
tested with gas or air after installation and proved tight at not less than the 
design pressure of the portable tank on which they are used. In the event of 
replacement, all such piping, valves, or fittings must be tested in accordance 
with the requirements of this section before the portable tank is returned to 
transportation service. The requirements of this section apply to all hoses used 
on portable tanks, except that hoses may be tested either before or after 
installation on the portable tank.
(7) All materials used in the construction of portable tanks and their 
appurtenances may not be subject to destructive attack by the contents of the 
portable tank.

(8) No aluminum, copper, silver, zinc nor their alloys may be used. Brazed 
joints may not be used. All parts of a portable tank and its appurtenances used 
for anhydrous ammonia must be steel.

(9) Each outlet of a portable tank used for the transportation of 
non-refrigerated liquefied compressed gases, except carbon dioxide, must be 
provided with a suitable automatic excess-flow valve (see definition in 
§ 178.337-1(g) of this subchapter). The valve must be located inside the 
portable tank or at a point outside the portable tank where the line enters or 
leaves the portable tank. The valve seat must be located inside the portable 
tank or may be located within a welded flange or its companion flange, or within 
a nozzle or within a coupling. The installation must be made in such a manner as 
to reasonably assure that any undue strain which causes failure requiring 
functioning of the valve shall cause failure in such a manner that it will not 
impair the operation of the valve.

(i) A safety device connection or liquid level gauging device that is 
constructed so that the outward flow of the tank contents will not exceed that 
passed by an opening of 0.1397 cm (0.0550 inches) is not required to be equipped 
with excess-flow valves.

(ii) An excess-flow valve must close automatically if the flow reaches the rated 
flow of gas or liquid specified by the original valve manufacturer when piping 
mounted directly on the valve is sheared off before the first valve, pump, or 
fitting downstream from the excess flow valve.

(iii) An excess-flow valve may be designed with a by-pass, not to exceed a 
0.1016 cm (0.040 inches) diameter opening to allow equalization of pressure.

(iv) Filling and discharge lines must be provided with manually operated 
shut-off valves located as close to the tank as practical. Unless this valve is 
manually operable at the valve, the line must also have a manual shut-off valve. 
The use of “Stop-Check” valves to satisfy with one valve the requirements of 
this section is forbidden. For portable tanks used for refrigerated liquefied 
gases, a “stop check” valve may be used on the vapor side of the pressure 
buildup circuit.

(10) Each portable tank used for carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide must be lagged 
with a suitable insulation material of such thickness that the overall thermal 
conductance is not more than 0.08 Btu per square foot per degree Fahrenheit 
differential in temperature per hour. The conductance must be determined at 60 
°Fahrenheit. Insulation material used on portable tanks for nitrous oxide must 
be noncombustible.

(11) Refrigerating or heating coils must be installed in portable tanks used for 
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Such coils must be tested externally to at 
least the same pressure as the test pressure of the portable tank. The coils 
must also be tested internally to at least twice the working pressure of the 
heating or refrigerating system to be used, but in no case less than the test 
pressure of the portable tank. Such coils must be securely anchored. In the 
event of leakage, the refrigerant or heating medium to be circulated through the 
coil or coils must have no adverse chemical reaction with the portable tank or 
its contents.

§ 173.33

Hazardous materials in cargo tank motor vehicles.

(a) 
General requirements.
(1) No person may offer or accept a hazardous material for transportation in a 
cargo tank motor vehicle except as authorized by this subchapter.
(2) Two or more materials may not be loaded or accepted for transportation in 
the same cargo tank motor vehicle if, as a result of any mixture of the 
materials, an unsafe condition would occur, such as an explosion, fire, 
excessive increase in pressure or heat, or the release of toxic vapors.

(3) No person may fill and offer for transportation a specification cargo tank 
motor vehicle for which the prescribed periodic retest or reinspection under 
subpart E of part 180 of this subchapter is past due until the retest or 
inspection has been successfully completed. This requirement does not apply to a 
cargo tank supplied by a motor carrier who is other than the person offering the 
hazardous material for transportation (see § 180.407(a)(1) of this subchapter), 
or to any cargo tank filled prior to the retest or inspection due date.

(b) 
Loading requirements.
(1) A hazardous material may not be loaded in a cargo tank if during 
transportation any part of the tank in contact with the hazardous material 
lading would have a dangerous reaction with the hazardous material.
(2) A cargo tank may not be loaded with a hazardous material that will have an 
adverse effect on the tank's integrity or—

(i) May combine chemically with any residue or contaminants in the tank to 
produce an explosion, fire, excessive increase in pressure, release of toxic 
vapors or other unsafe condition.

(ii)-(iii) [Reserved]

(iv) May severely corrode or react with the tank material at any concentration 
and temperature that will exist during transportation.

(v) Is prohibited by § 173.21 or § 173.24 of this subchapter.

(3) Air pressure in excess of ambient atmospheric pressure may not be used to 
load or unload any lading which may create an air-enriched mixture within the 
flammability range of the lading in the vapor space of the tank.

(4) To prevent cargo tank rupture in a loading or unloading accident, the 
loading or unloading rate used must be less than or equal to that indicated on 
the cargo tank specification plate, except as specified in § 173.318(b)(6). If 
no loading or unloading rate is marked on the specification plate, the loading 
or unloading rate and pressure used must be limited such that the pressure in 
the tank may not exceed 130% of the MAWP.

(c) 
Maximum Lading Pressure.
(1) Prior to loading and offering a cargo tank motor vehicle for transportation 
with material that requires the use of a specification cargo tank, the person 
must confirm that the cargo tank motor vehicle conforms to the specification 
required for the lading and that the MAWP of the cargo tank is greater than or 
equal to the largest pressure obtained under the following conditions:
(i) For compressed gases and certain refrigerated liquids that are not cryogenic 
liquids, the pressure prescribed in § 173.315 of this subchapter.

(ii) For cryogenic liquids, the pressure prescribed in § 173.318 of this 
subchapter.

(iii) For liquid hazardous materials loaded in DOT specification cargo tanks 
equipped with a 1 psig normal vent, the sum of the tank static head plus 1 psig. 
In addition, for hazardous materials loaded in these cargo tanks, the vapor 
pressure of the lading at 115 °F must be not greater than 1 psig, except for 
gasoline transported in accordance with Special Provision B33 in § 172.102(c)(3) 
of this subchapter.

(iv) For liquid hazardous materials not covered in paragraph (c)(1)(i), (ii), or 
(iii) of this section, the sum of the vapor pressure of the lading at 115 °F, 
plus the tank static head exerted by the lading, plus any pressure exerted by 
the gas padding, including air in the ullage space or dome.

(v) The pressure prescribed in subpart B, D, E, F, G, or H of this part, as 
applicable.

(vi) The maximum pressure in the tank during loading or unloading.

(2) Any Specification MC 300, MC 301, MC 302, MC 303, MC 305, MC 306 or MC 312, 
cargo tank motor vehicle with no marked design pressure or marked with 
a design pressure of 3 psig or less may be used for an authorized lading where 
the pressure derived from § 173.33(c)(1) is less than or equal to 3 psig. After 
December 31, 1990, a cargo tank may not be loaded and offered for transportation 
unless marked or remarked with an MAWP or design pressure in accordance with 49 
CFR 180.405(k).
(3) Any Specification MC 310 or MC 311 cargo tank motor vehicle may be used for 
an authorized lading where the pressure derived from § 173.33(c)(1) is less than 
or equal to the MAWP or MWP, respectively, as marked on the specification plate.

(4) Any cargo tank marked or certified before August 31, 1995, marked with a 
design pressure rather than an MAWP may be used for an authorized lading where 
the largest pressure derived from § 173.33(c)(1) is less than or equal to the 
design pressure marked on the cargo tank.

(5) Any material that meets the definition of a Division 6.1, Packing Group I or 
II (poisonous liquid) material must be loaded in a cargo tank motor vehicle 
having a MAWP of 25 psig or greater.

(6) 
Substitute packagings.
Unless otherwise specified, where MC 307, MC 312, DOT 407 or DOT 412 cargo tanks 
are authorized, minimum tank design pressure is 172.4 kPa (25 psig) for any 
Packing Group I or Packing Group II liquid lading that meets more than one 
hazard class definition.
(d) 
Relief system.
(1) Non-reclosing pressure relief devices are not authorized in any cargo tank 
except when in series with a reclosing pressure relief device. However, a cargo 
tank marked or certified before August 31, 1995 which is fitted with 
non-reclosing pressure relief devices may continue to be used in any hazardous 
material service for which it is authorized. The requirements in this paragraph 
do not apply to MC 330, MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks.
(2) Each cargo tank motor vehicle used to transport a liquid hazardous material 
with a gas pad must have a pressure relief system that provides the venting 
capacity prescribed in § 178.345-10(e) of this subchapter. The requirements in 
this paragraph do not apply to MC 330, MC 331 and MC 338 cargo tanks.

(3) A cargo tank motor vehicle made to a specification listed in column 1 may 
have pressure relief devices or outlets conforming to the applicable 
specification to which the tank was constructed, or the pressure relief devices 
or outlets may be modified to meet the applicable requirement for the 
specification listed in column 2 without changing the markings on the tank 
specification plate. The venting capacity requirements of the original DOT cargo 
tank specification must be met whenever a pressure relief valve is modified.

(e) 
Retention of hazardous materials in product piping during transportation.
DOT specification cargo tanks used for the transportation of any material that 
is a Division 6.1 (poisonous liquid) material, oxidizer liquid, liquid organic 
peroxide or corrosive liquid (corrosive to skin only) may not be transported 
with hazardous materials lading retained in the piping, unless the cargo tank 
motor vehicle is equipped with bottom damage protection devices meeting the 
requirements of § 178.337-10 or § 178.345-8(b) of this subchapter, or the 
accident damage protection requirements of the specification under which it was 
manufactured. This requirement does not apply to a residue which remains after 
the piping is drained. A sacrificial device (see § 178.345-1 of this subchapter) 
may not be used to satisfy the accident damage protection requirements of this 
paragraph.
(f) An MC 331 type cargo tank may be used where MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, DOT 406, 
DOT 407 or DOT 412 type cargo tanks are authorized. An MC 307, MC 312, DOT 407 
or DOT 412 type cargo tank may be used where MC 306 or DOT 406 type cargo tanks 
are authorized. A higher integrity tank used instead of a 
specified tank must meet the same design profile (for example, an MC 331 cargo 
tank must be lined if used in place of a lined MC 312 cargo tank.)
(g) 
Remote control of self-closing stop valves—MC 330, MC 331 and MC 338 cargo 
tanks.
Each liquid or vapor discharge opening in an MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank and 
each liquid filling and liquid discharge line in an MC 338 cargo tank must be 
provided with a remotely controlled internal self-closing stop valve except when 
an MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank is marked and used exclusively to transport 
carbon dioxide; an MC 338 is used to transport argon, carbon dioxide, helium, 
krypton, neon, nitrogen, or xenon; or an MC 338 utilizes an external 
self-closing stop valve to comply with the requirements in § 178.338-11(b). 
However, if the cargo tank motor vehicle was certified before January 1, 1995, 
this requirement is applicable only when an MC 330 or MC 331 cargo tank is used 
to transport a flammable liquid, flammable gas, hydrogen chloride (refrigerated 
liquid), or anhydrous ammonia; or when an MC 338 cargo tank is used to transport 
flammable ladings.
(h) A cargo tank motor vehicle authorized by the Transport Canada TDG 
Regulations (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) may be used provided it 
conforms to the applicable requirements in § 171.12 of this subchapter.

§ 173.34

[Reserved]


§ 173.35

Hazardous materials in IBCs.

(a) No person may offer or accept a hazardous material for transportation in an 
IBC except as authorized by this subchapter. Each IBC used for the 
transportation of hazardous materials must conform to the requirements of its 
specification and regulations for the transportation of the particular 
commodity. A specification IBC, for which the prescribed periodic retest or 
inspection under subpart D of part 180 of this subchapter is past due, may not 
be filled and offered for transportation until the retest or inspection have 
been successfully completed. This requirement does not apply to any IBC filled 
prior to the retest or inspection due date.

(b) 
Initial use and reuse of IBCs.
(Also see § 180.352 of this subchapter.) An IBC other than a multiwall paper IBC 
(13M1 and 13M2) may be reused. If an inner liner is required, the inner liner 
must be replaced before each reuse. Before an IBC is filled and offered for 
transportation, the IBC and its service equipment must be given an external 
visual inspection, by the person filling the IBC, to ensure that:
(1) The IBC is free from corrosion, contamination, cracks, cuts, or other damage 
which would render it unable to pass the prescribed design type test to which it 
is certified and marked; and

(2) The IBC is marked in accordance with requirements in § 178.703 of this 
subchapter. Additional marking allowed for each design type may be present. 
Required markings that are missing, damaged or difficult to read must be 
restored or returned to original condition.

(c) A metal IBC, or a part thereof, subject to thinning by mechanical abrasion 
or corrosion due to the lading, must be protected by providing a suitable 
increase in thickness of material, a lining or some other suitable method of 
protection. Increased thickness for corrosion or abrasion protection must be 
added to the wall thickness specified in § 178.705(c)(1)(iv) of this subchapter.

(d) Notwithstanding requirements in § 173.24b of this subpart, when filling an 
IBC with liquids, sufficient ullage must be left to ensure that, at the mean 
bulk temperature of 50 °C (122 °F), the IBC is not filled to more than 98 
percent of its water capacity.

(e) Where two or more closure systems are fitted in series, the system nearest 
to the hazardous material being carried must be closed first.

(f) During transportation—

(1) No hazardous material may remain on the outside of the IBC; and

(2) Each IBC must be securely fastened to or contained within the transport 
unit.

(g) Each IBC used for transportation of solids which may become liquid at 
temperatures likely to be encountered 
during transportation must also be capable of containing the substance in the 
liquid state.
(h) Liquid hazardous materials may only be offered for transportation in a 
metal, rigid plastic, or composite IBC that is appropriately resistant to an 
increase in internal pressure likely to develop during transportation.

(1) A rigid plastic or composite IBC may only be filled with a liquid having a 
vapor pressure less than or equal to the greater of the following two values: 
The first value is determined from any of the methods in paragraphs (h)(1)(i), 
(ii) or (iii) of this section. The second value is determined by the method in 
paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.

(i) The gauge pressure (pressure in the IBC above ambient atmospheric pressure) 
measured in the IBC at 55 °C (131 °F). This gauge pressure must not exceed 
two-thirds of the marked test pressure and must be determined after the IBC was 
filled and closed at 15 °C (60 °F) to less than or equal to 98 percent of its 
capacity.

(ii) The absolute pressure (vapor pressure of the hazardous material plus 
atmospheric pressure) in the IBC at 50 °C (122 °F). This absolute pressure must 
not exceed four-sevenths of the sum of the marked test pressure and 100 kPa 
(14.5 psia).

(iii) The absolute pressure (vapor pressure of the hazardous material plus 
atmospheric pressure) in the IBC at 55 °C (131 °F). This absolute pressure must 
not exceed two-thirds of the sum of the marked test pressure and 100 kPa (14.5 
psia).

(iv) Twice the static pressure of the substance, measured at the bottom of the 
IBC. This value must not be less than twice the static pressure of water.

(2) Liquids having a vapor pressure greater than 110 kPa (16 psig) at 50 °C (122 
°F) or 130 kPa (18.9 psig) at 55 °C (131 °F) may not be transported in metal 
IBCs.

(i) The requirements in this section do not apply to DOT-56 or -57 portable 
tanks.

(j) No IBC may be filled with a Packing Group I liquid. Rigid plastic, 
composite, flexible, wooden or fiberboard IBC used to transport Packing Group I 
solid materials may not exceed 1.5 cubic meters (53 cubic feet) capacity. For 
Packing Group I solids, a metal IBC may not exceed 3 cubic meters (106 cubic 
feet) capacity.

(k) When an IBC is used for the transportation of liquids with a flash point of 
60 °C (140 °F) (closed cup) or lower, or powders with the potential for dust 
explosion, measures must be taken during product loading and unloading to 
prevent a dangerous electrostatic discharge.

(l) 
IBC filling limits.
(1) Except as provided in this section, an IBC may not be filled with a 
hazardous material in excess of the maximum gross mass marked on that container.
(2) An IBC which is tested and marked for Packing Group II liquid materials may 
be filled with a Packing Group III liquid material to a gross mass not exceeding 
1.5 times the maximum gross mass marked on that container, if all the 
performance criteria can still be met at the higher gross mass.

(3) An IBC which is tested and marked for liquid hazardous materials may be 
filled with a solid hazardous material to a gross mass not exceeding the maximum 
gross mass marked on that container. In addition, an IBC intended for the 
transport of liquids which is tested and marked for Packing Group II liquid 
materials may be filled with a Packing Group III solid hazardous material to a 
gross mass not exceeding the marked maximum gross mass multiplied by 1.5 if all 
the performance criteria can still be met at the higher gross mass.

(4) An IBC which is tested and marked for Packing Group I solid materials may be 
filled with a Packing Group II solid material to a gross mass not exceeding the 
maximum gross mass marked on that container, multiplied by 1.5, if all the 
performance criteria can be met at the higher gross mass; or a Packing Group III 
solid material to a gross mass not exceeding the maximum gross mass marked on 
the IBC, multiplied by 2.25, if all the performance criteria can be met at the 
higher gross mass. An IBC which is tested and marked for Packing Group II solid 
materials may be filled with a Packing Group III solid material to a gross mass 
not exceeding the maximum gross 
mass marked on the IBC, multiplied by 1.5.

(1) DOT specification cylinders must conform to the following:

(i) Each cylinder with a wall thickness at any point of less than 2.03 mm (0.08 
inch) and each cylinder that does not have fitted valve protection must be 
overpacked in a box. The box must conform to overpack provisions in § 173.25. 
Box and valve protection must be of sufficient strength to protect all parts of 
the cylinder and valve, if any, from deformation and breakage resulting from a 
drop of 2.0 m (7 ft) or more onto a non-yielding surface, such as concrete or 
steel, impacting at an orientation most likely to cause damage. 
“Deformation”means a cylinder or valve that is bent, distorted, mangled, 
misshapen, twisted, warped, or in a similar condition.

(ii) Each cylinder with a valve must be equipped with a protective metal or 
plastic cap, other valve protection device, or an overpack which is sufficient 
to protect the valve from breakage or leakage resulting from a drop of 2.0 m (7 
ft) onto a non-yielding surface, such as concrete or steel. Impact must be at an 
orientation most likely to cause damage.

(2) Each UN cylinder containing a Hazard Zone A or Hazard Zone B material must 
have a minimum test pressure in accordance with P200 of the UN Recommendations 
(IBR, see § 171.7 of 
this subchapter). For Hazard Zone A gases, the cylinder must have a minimum wall 
thickness of 3.5 mm if made of aluminum alloy or 2 mm if made of steel or, 
alternatively, cylinders may be packed in a rigid outer packaging that meets the 
Packing Group I performance level when tested as prepared for transport, and 
that is designed and constructed to protect the cylinder and valve from puncture 
or damage that may result in release of the gas.
(e) 
Interconnection.
Cylinders may not be manifolded or connected. This provision does not apply to 
MEGCs containing Hazard Zone B materials in accordance with § 173.312.

§ 173.41

Sampling and testing program for unrefined petroleum-based products.

(a) 
General.
Unrefined petroleum-based products offered for transportation must be properly 
classed and described as prescribed in § 173.22, in accordance with a sampling 
and testing program, which specifies at a minimum:
(1) A frequency of sampling and testing that accounts for any appreciable 
variability of the material (
e.g.,
history, temperature, method of extraction [including chemical use], location of 
extraction, time of year, length of time between shipments);
(2) Sampling prior to the initial offering of the material for transportation 
and when changes that may affect the properties of the material occur (
i.e.,
mixing of the material from multiple sources, or further processing and then 
subsequent transportation);
(3) Sampling methods that ensure a representative sample of the entire mixture, 
as offered, is collected;

(4) Testing methods that enable classification of the material under the HMR;

(5) Quality control measures for sample frequencies;

(6) Duplicate sampling methods or equivalent measures for quality assurance;

(7) Criteria for modifying the sampling and testing program; and

(8) Testing or other appropriate methods used to identify properties of the 
mixture relevant to packaging requirements (
e.g.,
compatibility with packaging, identifying specific gravity for filling 
packages).
(b) 
Certification.
Each person who offers a hazardous material for transportation shall certify, as 
prescribed by § 172.204 of this subchapter, that the material is offered for 
transportation in accordance with this subchapter, including the requirements 
prescribed by paragraph (a) of this section.
(c) 
Documentation, retention, review, and dissemination of program.
The sampling and testing program must be documented in writing (
i.e.
hardcopy or electronic file thereof) and must be retained for as long as the 
sampling and testing program remains in effect, or a minimum of one year. The 
sampling and testing program must be reviewed at least annually and revised 
and/or updated as necessary to reflect changed circumstances. The most recent 
version of the sampling and testing program must be available to the employees 
who are responsible for implementing it. When the sampling and testing program 
is updated or revised, all employees responsible for implementing it must be 
notified, and the most recent version must be made available.
(d) 
Access by DOT to program documentation.
Each person required to develop and implement a sampling and testing program 
must maintain a copy of the sampling and testing program documentation (or an 
electronic file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, its principal place 
of business, and must make the documentation available upon request at a 
reasonable time and location to an authorized official of the Department of 
Transportation.

Subpart C—Definitions, Classification and Packaging for Class 1


Source:

Amdt. 173-224, 55 FR 52617, Dec. 21, 1990, unless otherwise noted.



§ 173.50

Class 1—Definitions.

(a) 
Explosive.
For the purposes of this subchapter, an 
explosive
means any substance or article, including a device, which is designed to 
function by explosion (
i.e.,
an extremely rapid release of gas and heat) or which, by chemical reaction 
within itself, is able to function in a similar manner even if not designed to 
function by explosion, unless the substance or article is otherwise classed 
under the provisions of this subchapter. The term includes a pyrotechnic 
substance or article, unless the substance or article is otherwise classed under 
the provisions of this subchapter.
(b) Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as follows:

(1) 
Division 1.1
consists of explosives that have a mass explosion hazard. A mass explosion is 
one which affects almost the entire load instantaneously.
(2) 
Division 1.2
consists of explosives that have a projection hazard but not a mass explosion 
hazard.
(3) 
Division 1.3
consists of explosives that have a fire hazard and either a minor blast hazard 
or a minor projection hazard or both, but not a mass explosion hazard.
(4) 
Division 1.4
consists of explosives that present a minor explosion hazard. The explosive 
effects are largely confined to the package and no projection of fragments of 
appreciable size or range is to be expected. An external fire must not cause 
virtually instantaneous explosion of almost the entire contents of the package.
(5) 
Division 1.5
 
1

consists of very insensitive explosives. This division is comprised of 
substances which have a mass explosion hazard but are so insensitive that there 
is very little probability of initiation or of transition from burning to 
detonation under normal conditions of transport.


1
 The probability of transition from burning to detonation is greater when large 
quantities are transported in a vessel.
(6) 
Division 1.6
 
2

consists of extremely insensitive articles that do not have a mass explosion 
hazard. This division is comprised of articles that contain only extremely 
insensitive substances and that demonstrate a negligible probability of 
accidental initiation or propagation.


2
 The risk from articles of Division 1.6 is limited to the explosion of a single 
article.

§ 173.51

Authorization to offer and transport explosives.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, no person may offer for 
transportation or transport an explosive, unless it has been tested and classed 
and approved by the Associate Administrator (§ 173.56).

(b) Reports of explosives approved by the Department of Defense or the 
Department of Energy must be filed with, and receive acknowledgement in writing 
by, the Associate Administrator prior to such explosives being offered for 
transportation.

§ 173.52

Classification codes and compatibility groups of explosives.

(a) The classification code for an explosive, which is assigned by the Associate 
Administrator in accordance with this subpart, consists of the division number 
followed by the compatibility group letter. Compatibility group letters are used 
to specify the controls for the transportation, and storage related thereto, of 
explosives and to prevent an increase in hazard that might result if certain 
types of explosives were stored or transported together. Transportation 
compatibility requirements for carriers are prescribed in §§ 174.81, 175.78. 
176.83 and 177.848 of this subchapter for transportation by rail, air, vessel, 
and public highway, respectively, and storage incidental thereto.

(b) Compatibility groups and classification codes for the various types of 
explosives are set forth in the following tables. Table 1 sets forth 
compatibility 
groups and classification codes for substances and articles described in the 
first column of table 1. Table 2 shows the number of classification codes that 
are possible within each explosive division. Altogether, there are 35 possible 
classification codes for explosives.

§ 173.56

New explosives—definition and procedures for classification and approval.

(a) Definition of new explosive. For the purposes of this subchapter a 
new explosive
means an explosive produced by a person who:
(1) Has not previously produced that explosive; or

(2) Has previously produced that explosive but has made a change in the 
formulation, design or process so as to alter any of the properties of the 
explosive. An explosive will not be considered a “new explosive” if an agency 
listed in paragraph (b) of this section has determined, and confirmed in writing 
to the Associate Administrator, that there are no significant differences in 
hazard characteristics from the explosive previously approved.

(b) Examination, classification and approval. Except as provided in §§ 173.64 
and 173.65, no person may offer a new explosive for transportation unless that 
person has specified to the examining agency the ranges of composition of 
ingredients and compounds, showing the intended manufacturing tolerances in the 
composition of substances or design of articles which will be allowed in that 
material or device, and unless it has been examined, classed and approved as 
follows:

(1) Except for an explosive made by or under the direction or supervision of the 
Department of Defense (DOD) or the Department of Energy (DOE), a new explosive 
must be examined and assigned a recommended shipping description, division and 
compatibility group, based on the tests and criteria prescribed in §§ 173.52, 
173.57 and 173.58. The person requesting approval of the 
new explosive must submit to the Associate Administrator a report of the 
examination and assignment of a recommended shipping description, division, and 
compatibility group. If the Associate Administrator finds the approval request 
meets the regulatory criteria, the new explosive will be approved in writing and 
assigned an EX number. The examination must be performed by a person who is 
approved by the Associate Administrator under the provisions of subpart H of 
part 107 of this chapter and who—
(i) Has (directly, or through an employee involved in the examination) at least 
ten years of experience in the examination, testing and evaluation of 
explosives;

(ii) Does not manufacture or market explosives, and is not controlled by or 
financially dependent on any entity that manufactures or markets explosives, and 
whose work with respect to explosives is limited to examination, testing and 
evaluation; and

(iii) Is a resident of the United States.

(2) A new explosive made by or under the direction or supervision of a component 
of the DOD may be examined, classed, and concurred in by:

(i) U.S. Army Technical Center for Explosives Safety (SMCAC-EST), Naval Sea 
Systems Command (SEA-9934), or Air Force Safety Agency (SEW), when approved by 
the Chairman, DOD Explosives Board, in accordance with the DOD Explosives Hazard 
Classification Procedures (IBR, see § 171.7 of the subchapter); or

(ii) The agencies and procedures specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

(3) A new explosive made by or under the direction or supervision of the 
Department of Energy (DOE) may be—

(i) Examined by the DOE in accordance with the DOD Explosives Hazard 
Classification Procedures, and must be classed and approved by DOE; or

(ii) Examined, classed, and approved in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section.

(4) For a material shipped under the description of “ammonium nitrate-fuel oil 
mixture (ANFO)”, the only test required for classification purposes is the Cap 
Sensitivity Test—Test Method 5(a) prescribed in the Explosive Test Manual (UN 
Manual of Tests and Criteria) (IBR, see § 171.7 of the subchapter). The test 
must be performed by an agency listed in paragraph (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of 
this section, the manufacturer, or the shipper. A copy of the test report must 
be submitted to the Associate Administrator before the material is offered for 
transportation, and a copy of the test report must be retained by the shipper 
for as long as that material is shipped. At a minimum, the test report must 
contain the name and address of the person or organization conducting the test, 
date of the test, quantitative description of the mixture, including prill size 
and porosity, and a description of the test results.

(c) Filing DOD or DOE approval report. DOD or DOE must file a copy of each 
approval, accompanied by supporting laboratory data, with the Associate 
Administrator and receive acknowledgement in writing before offering the new 
explosive for transportation, unless the new explosive is:

(1) Being transported under paragraph (d) or (e) of this section; or

(2) Covered by a national security classification currently in effect.

(d) Transportation of explosive samples for examination. Notwithstanding the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section with regard to the transportation 
of a new explosive that has not been approved, a person may offer a sample of a 
new explosive for transportation, by railroad, highway, or vessel from the place 
where it was produced to an agency identified in paragraph (b) of this section, 
for examination if—

(1) The new explosive has been assigned a tentative shipping description and 
class in writing by the testing agency;

(2) The new explosive is packaged as required by this part according to the 
tentative description and class assigned, unless otherwise specified in writing 
by the testing agency; and,

(3) The package is labeled as required by this subchapter and the following is 
marked on the package:

(i) The words “SAMPLE FOR LABORATORY EXAMINATION”;

(ii) The net weight of the new explosive; and

(iii) The tentative shipping name and identification number.

(e) Transportation of unapproved explosives for developmental testing. 
Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, the owner of 
a new explosive that has not been examined or approved may transport that new 
explosive from the place where it was produced to an explosives testing range 
if—

(1) It is not a primary (a 1.1A initiating) explosive or a forbidden explosive 
according to this subchapter;

(2) It is described as a Division 1.1 explosive (substance or article) and is 
packed, marked, labeled, described on shipping papers and is otherwise offered 
for transportation in conformance with the requirements of this subchapter 
applicable to Division 1.1;

(3) It is transported in a motor vehicle operated by the owner of the explosive; 
and

(4) It is accompanied by a person, in addition to the operator of the motor 
vehicle, who is qualified by training and experience to handle the explosive.

(f) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (d) of this section, 
the Associate Administrator may approve a new explosive on the basis of an 
approval issued for the explosive by the competent authority of a foreign 
government, or when examination of the explosive by a person approved by the 
Associate Administrator is impracticable, on the basis of reports of tests 
conducted by disinterested third parties, or may approve the transportation of 
an explosives sample for the purpose of examination by a person approved by the 
Associate Administrator.

(g) An explosive may be transported under subparts B or C of part 171 or 
§ 176.11 of this subchapter without the approval of the Associate Administrator 
as required by paragraph (b) of this section if the Associate Administrator has 
acknowledged in writing the acceptability of an approval issued by the competent 
authority of a foreign government pursuant to the provisions of the UN 
Recommendations, the ICAO Technical Instructions, the IMDG Code (IBR, see 
§ 171.7 of this subchapter), or other national or international regulations 
based on the UN Recommendations. In such a case, a copy of the foreign competent 
authority approval, and a copy of the written acknowledgement of its acceptance 
must accompany each shipment of that explosive.

(h) The requirements of this section do not apply to cartridges, small arms 
which are:

(1) Not a forbidden explosive under § 173.54 of this subchapter;

(2) Ammunition for rifle, pistol, shotgun, or tools;

(3) Ammunition with inert projectile or blank ammunition; and

(4) Ammunition not exceeding 50 caliber for rifle or pistol cartridges or 8 
gauge for shotgun shells.

Cartridges, small arms meeting the criteria of this paragraph (h) may be 
assigned a classification code of 1.4S by the manufacturer.

(i) If experience or other data indicate that the hazard of a material or a 
device containing an explosive composition is greater or less than indicated 
according to the definition and criteria specified in §§ 173.50, 173.56, and 
173.58 of this subchapter, the Associate Administrator may specify a 
classification or except the material or device from the requirements of this 
subchapter.

drill shaft to assist the flow of crude oil from the rock.

Fuse/Fuze.
Although these two words have a common origin (French fusee, fusil) and are 
sometimes considered to be different spellings, it is useful to maintain the 
convention that fuse refers to a cord-like igniting device, whereas fuze refers 
to a device used in ammunition which incorporates mechanical, electrical, 
chemical, or hydrostatic components to initiate a train by deflagration or 
detonation.

deflagrating train of explosive or pyrotechnic substances (for example: a primer 
for propelling charge, an igniter for a rocket motor or an igniting fuze).

Initiation, means of.
(1) A device intended to cause the detonation of an explosive (for example: 
detonator, detonator for ammunition, or detonating fuze).
(2) The term 
with its own means of initiation
means that the contrivance has its normal initiating device assembled to it and 
this device is considered to present a significant risk during transport but not 
one great enough to be unacceptable. The term does not apply, however, to a 
contrivance packed together with its means of initiation, provided the device is 
packaged so as to eliminate the risk of causing detonation of the contrivance in 
the event of functioning of the initiating device. The initiating device can 
even be assembled in the contrivance provided there are protective features 
ensuring that the device is very unlikely to cause detonation of the contrivance 
under conditions which are associated with transport.
(3) For the purposes of classification, any means of initiation without two 
effective protective features should be regarded as Compatibility Group B; an 
article with its own means of initiation, without two effective protective 
features, is Compatibility Group F. A means of initiation which itself possesses 
two effective protective features is Compatibility Group D, and an article with 
its own means of initiation which possesses two effective features is 
Compatibility Group D or E. A means of initiation, adjudged as having two 
effective protective features, must be approved by the Associate Administrator. 
A common and effective way of achieving the necessary degree of protection is to 
use a means of initiation which incorporates two or more independent safety 
features.

personnel. The term includes Bangalore torpedoes.

Phlegmatized.
The term means that a substance (or “phlegmatizer”) has been added to an 
explosive to enhance its safety in handling and transport. The phlegmatizer 
renders the explosive insensitive, or less sensitive, to the following actions: 
heat, shock, impact, percussion or friction. Typical phlegmatizing agents 
include, but are not limited to: wax, paper, water, polymers (such as 
chlorofluoropolymers), alcohol and oils (such as petroleum jelly and paraffin).

§ 173.60

General packaging requirements for explosives.

(a) Unless otherwise provided in this subpart and in § 173.7(a), packaging used 
for Class 1 (explosives) materials must meet Packing Group II requirements. Each 
packaging used for an explosive must be capable of meeting the test requirements 
of subpart M of part 178 of this subchapter, at the specified level of 
performance, and the applicable general packaging requirements of paragraph (b) 
of this section.

(b) The general requirements for packaging of explosives are as follows:

(1) Nails, staples, and other closure devices, made of metal, having no 
protective covering may not penetrate to the inside of the outer packaging 
unless the inner packaging adequately protects the explosive against contact 
with the metal.

(2) The closure device of containers for liquid explosives must provide double 
protection against leakage, such as a screw cap secured in place with tape.

(3) Inner packagings, fittings, and cushioning materials, and the placing of 
explosive substances or articles in packages, must be such that the explosive 
substance is prevented from becoming loose in the outer packaging during 
transportation. Metallic components of articles must be prevented from making 
contact with metal packagings. Articles containing explosive substances not 
enclosed in an outer casing must be separated from each other in order to 
prevent friction and impact. Padding, trays, partitioning in the inner or outer 
packaging, molded plastics or receptacles may be used for this purpose.

(4) When the packaging includes water that could freeze during transportation, a 
sufficient amount of anti-freeze, such as denatured ethyl alcohol, must be added 
to the water to prevent freezing. If the anti-freeze creates a fire hazard, it 
may not be used. When a percentage of water in the substance is specified, the 
combined weight of water and anti-freeze may be substituted.

(5) If an article is fitted with its own means of ignition or initiation, it 
must be effectively protected from accidental actuation during normal conditions 
of transportation.

(6) The entry of explosive substances into the recesses of double-seamed metal 
packagings must be prevented.

(7) The closure device of a metal drum must include a suitable gasket; if the 
closure device includes metal-to-metal screw-threads, the ingress of explosive 
substances into the threading must be prevented.

(8) Whenever loose explosive substances or the explosive substance of an uncased 
or partly cased article may come into contact with the inner surface of metal 
packagings (1A2, 1B2, 4A, 4B and metal receptacles), the metal packaging should 
be provided with an inner liner or coating.

(9) Packagings must be made of materials compatible with, and impermeable to, 
the explosives contained in the package, so that neither interaction between the 
explosives and the packaging materials, nor leakage, causes the explosive to 
become unsafe in transportation, or the hazard division or compatibility group 
to change (
see
§ 173.24(e)(2)).
(10) An explosive article containing an electrical means of initiation that is 
sensitive to external electromagnetic radiation, must have its means of 
initiation effectively protected from electromagnetic radiation sources (for 
example, radar or radio transmitters) through either design of the packaging or 
of the article, or both.

(11) Plastic packagings may not be able to generate or accumulate sufficient 
static electricity to cause the packaged explosive substances or articles to 
initiate, ignite or inadvertently function. Metal packagings must be compatible 
with the explosive substance they contain.

(12) Explosive substances may not be packed in inner or outer packagings where 
the differences in internal and external pressures, due to thermal or other 
effects, could cause an explosion or rupture of the package.

(13) Packagings for water soluble substances must be water resistant. Packagings 
for desensitized or phlegmatized substances must be closed to prevent changes in 
concentration during transport. When containing less alcohol, water, or 
phlegmatizer than specified 
in its proper shipping description, the substance is a “forbidden” material.
(14) Large and robust explosives articles, normally intended for military use, 
without their means of initiation or with their means of initiation containing 
at least two effective protective features, may be carried unpackaged provided 
that a negative result was obtained in Test Series 4 of the UN Manual of Tests 
and Criteria on an unpackaged article. When such articles have propelling 
charges or are self-propelled, their ignition systems must be protected against 
conditions encountered during normal transportation. Such unpackaged articles 
may be fixed to cradles or contained in crates or other suitable handling, 
storage or launching devices in such a way that they will not become loose 
during normal conditions of transport and are in accordance with DOD-approved 
procedures. When such large explosive articles, as part of their operational 
safety and suitability tests, are subjected to testing that meets the intentions 
of Test Series 4 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria with successful test 
results, they may be offered for transportation in accordance with the 
requirements prescribed in (b)(14) above subject to approval by the Associate 
Administrator.

2000; 76 FR 43529, July 20, 2011]


§ 173.61

Mixed packaging requirements.

(a) An explosive may not be packed in the same outside packaging with any other 
material that could, under normal conditions of transportation, adversely affect 
the explosive or its packaging unless packaged by DOD or DOE in accordance with 
§ 173.7(a).

(b) Hardware necessary for assembly of explosive articles at the point-of-use 
may be packed in the same outside packaging with the explosive articles. The 
hardware must be securely packed in a separate inside packaging. Sufficient 
cushioning materials must be used to ensure that all inside packagings are 
securely packed in the outside packaging.

(c) The following explosives may not be packed together with other Class 1 
explosives: UN 0029, UN 0030, UN 0073, UN 0106, UN 0107, UN 0255, UN 0257, UN 
0267, UN 0350, UN 0360, UN 0361, UN 0364, UN 0365, UN 0366, UN 0367, UN 0408, UN 
0409, UN 0410, UN 0455, UN 0456, and UN 0500. These explosives may be mix-packed 
with each other in accordance with the compatibility requirements prescribed in 
paragraph (e) of this section.

(d) Division 1.1 and 1.2 explosives may not be packed with the following 
explosives: UN 0333, UN 0334, UN 0335, UN 0336, and UN 0337.

(e) Except as prescribed in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, different 
explosives may be packed in one outside packaging in accordance with the 
following compatibility requirements:

(1) Explosives of the same compatibility group and same division number may be 
packed together.

(2) Explosives of the same compatibility group or authorized combination of 
compatibility group but different division number may be packed together, 
provided that the whole package is treated as though its entire contents were 
comprised of the lower division number. For example, a mixed package of Division 
1.2 explosives and Division 1.4 explosives, compatibility group D, must be 
treated as 1.2D explosives. However, when 1.5D explosives are packed together 
with 1.2D explosives, the whole package must be treated as 1.1D explosives.

(3) Explosives of compatibility group S may be packaged together with explosives 
of any other compatibility group except A or L, and the combined package may be 
treated as belonging to any of the packaged compatibility groups except S.

(4) Explosives of compatibility group L shall only be packed with an identical 
explosive.

(5) Explosives articles of compatibility groups C, D, or E may be packed 
together and the entire package shall be treated as belonging to compatibility 
group E.

(6) Explosives articles of compatibility groups C, D, E, or N may be packed 
together and the entire package shall be treated as belonging to compatibility 
group D.

(7) Explosives substances of compatibility groups C and D may be packaged 
together and the entire package shall be treated as belonging to compatibility 
group D.

(8) Explosive articles of compatibility group G, except for fireworks and 
articles requiring special packaging, may be packaged together with explosive 
articles of compatibility groups C, D or E and the combined package shall be 
treated as belonging to compatibility group E.

§ 173.62

Specific packaging requirements for explosives.

(a) Except as provided in § 173.7 of this subchapter, when the § 172.101 Table 
specifies that an explosive must be packaged in accordance with this section, 
only packagings which conform to the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of 
this section or § 173.7(e) of this subchapter and the applicable requirements in 
§§ 173.60 and 173.61 may be used unless otherwise approved by the Associate 
Administrator.

(b) 
Explosives Table.
The Explosives Table specifies the Packing Instructions assigned to each 
explosive. Explosives are identified in the first column in numerical sequence 
by their identification number (ID #), which is listed in column 4 of the 
§ 172.101 table, of this subchapter. The second column of the Explosives Table 
specifies the Packing Instruction (PI) which must be used for packaging the 
explosive. The Explosives Packing Method Table in paragraph (c) of this section 
defines the methods of packaging. The Packing Instructions are identified using 
a 3 digit designation. The Packing Instruction prefixed by the letters “US” is 
particular to the United States and not found in applicable international 
regulations.

(c) Explosives must be packaged in accordance with the following table:

(1) The first column lists, in alphanumeric sequence, the packing methods 
prescribed for explosives in the Explosives Table of paragraph (b) of this 
section.

(2) The second column specifies the inner packagings that are required. If inner 
packagings are not required, a notation of “Not necessary” appears in the 
column. The term “Not necessary” means that a suitable inner packaging may be 
used but is not required.

(3) The third column specifies the intermediate packagings that are required. If 
intermediate packagings are not required, a notation of “Not necessary” appears 
in the column. The term “Not necessary” means that a suitable intermediate 
packaging may be used but is not required.

(4) The fourth column specifies the outer packagings which are required. If 
inner packagings and/or intermediate packagings are specified in the second and 
third columns, then the packaging specified in the fourth column must be used as 
the outer packaging of a combination packaging; otherwise it may be used as a 
single packaging.

(5) Packing Instruction 101 may be used for any explosive substance or article 
if an equivalent level of safety is shown to be maintained subject to the 
approval of the Associate Administrator.

and robust explosives articles, normally intended for military use, without 
their means of initiation or with their means of initiation containing at least 
two effective protective features, may be carried unpackaged. When such articles 
have propelling charges or are self-propelled, their ignition systems must be 
protected against stimuli encountered during normal conditions of transport. A 
negative result in Test Series 4 on an unpackaged article indicates that the 
article can be considered for transport unpackaged. Such unpackaged articles may 
be fixed to cradles or contained in crates or other suitable handling devices
2. Subject to approval by the Associate Administrator, large explosive articles, 
as part of their operational safety and suitability tests, subjected to testing 
that meets the intentions of Test Series 4 of the UN Manual of Tests and 
Criteria with successful test results, may be offered for transportation in 
accordance with the requirements of this subchapter

°C (20 °F) a second test shall be made as follows: a portion of the mixture 
shall be placed in an open beaker (or similar container) of such dimensions that 
the height of the liquid can be adjusted so that the ratio of the volume of the 
liquid to the exposed surface area is 6 to one. The liquid shall be allowed to 
evaporate under ambient pressure and temperature (20 to 25 °C (68 to 77 °F)) for 
a period of 4 hours or until 10 percent by volume has evaporated, whichever 
comes first. A flash point is then run on a portion of the liquid remaining in 
the evaporation container and the lower of the two flash points shall be the 
flash point of the material.

This test is carried out at 23 °C (73 °F) using a 100.0 mL(3 ounces) measuring 
cylinder of the stoppered type of approximately 25.0 cm (9.8 inches) total 
height and of a uniform internal diameter of approximately 30 mm (1.2 inches) 
over the calibrated section. The sample should be stirred to obtain a uniform 
consistency, and poured in up to the 100 mL (3 ounces) mark. The stopper should 
be inserted and the cylinder left standing undisturbed for 24 hours. After 24 
hours, the height of the upper separated layer should be measured and the 
percentage of this layer as compared with the total height of the sample 
calculated.

(E) The Associate Administrator has determined that the material does not 
present a hazard which is associated with a Division 4.1 material.

(ii) 
Generic types.
Division 4.1 self-reactive materials are assigned to a generic system consisting 
of seven types. A self-reactive substance identified by technical name in the 
Self-Reactive Materials Table in § 173.224 is assigned to a generic type in 
accordance with that table. Self-reactive materials not identified in the 
Self-Reactive Materials Table in § 173.224 are assigned to generic types under 
the procedures of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section.
(A) 
Type A.
Self-reactive material type A is a self-reactive material which, as packaged for 
transportation, can detonate or deflagrate rapidly. Transportation of type A 
self-reactive material is forbidden.
(B) 
Type B.
Self-reactive material type B is a self-reactive material which, as packaged for 
transportation, neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly, but is liable to 
undergo a thermal explosion in a package.
(C) 
Type C.
Self-reactive material type C is a self-reactive material which, as packaged for 
transportation, neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly and cannot undergo a 
thermal explosion.
(D) 
Type D.
Self-reactive material type D is a self-reactive material which—
(
1
) Detonates partially, does not deflagrate rapidly and shows no violent effect 
when heated under confinement;
(
2
) Does not detonate at all, deflagrates slowly and shows no violent effect when 
heated under confinement; or
(
3
) Does not detonate or deflagrate at all and shows a medium effect when heated 
under confinement.

Type F.
Self-reactive material type F is a self-reactive material which, in laboratory 
testing, neither detonates in the cavitated state nor deflagrates at all and 
shows only a low or no effect when heated under confinement as well as low or no 
explosive power.
(G) 
Type G.
Self-reactive material type G is a self-reactive material which, in laboratory 
testing, does not detonate in the cavitated state, will not deflagrate at all, 
shows no effect when heated under confinement, nor shows any explosive power. A 
type G self-reactive material is not subject to the requirements of this 
subchapter for self-reactive material of Division 4.1 provided that it is 
thermally stable (self-accelerating decomposition temperature is 50 °C (122 °F) 
or higher for a 50 kg (110 pounds) package). A self-reactive material meeting 
all characteristics of type G except thermal stability is classed as a type F 
self-reactive, temperature control material.
(iii) 
Procedures for assigning a self-reactive material to a generic type.
A self-reactive material must be assigned to a generic type based on—
(A) Its physical state (i.e. liquid or solid), in accordance with the definition 
of liquid and solid in § 171.8 of this subchapter;

(B) A determination as to its control temperature and emergency temperature, if 
any, under the provisions of § 173.21(f);

(C) Performance of the self-reactive material under the test procedures 
specified in the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this 
subchapter) and the provisions of paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section; and

(D) Except for a self-reactive material which is identified by technical name in 
the Self-Reactive Materials Table in § 173.224(b) or a self-reactive material 
which may be shipped as a sample under the provisions of § 173.224, the 
self-reactive material is approved in writing by the Associate Administrator. 
The person requesting approval shall submit to the Associate Administrator the 
tentative shipping description and generic type and—

(
1
) All relevant data concerning physical state, temperature controls, and tests 
results; or
(
2
) An approval issued for the self-reactive material by the competent authority 
of a foreign government.

(iv) 
Tests.
The generic type for a self-reactive material must be determined using the 
testing protocol from Figure 20.1 (a)-(b) (Flow Chart Scheme for Self-Reactive 
Substances and Organic Peroxides) from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, 
see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
(3) Readily combustible solids are materials that—

(i) Are solids which may cause a fire through friction, such as matches;

(ii) Show a burning rate faster than 2.2 mm (0.087 inches) per second when 
tested in accordance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 
of this subchapter); or

(iii) Any metal powders that can be ignited and react over the whole length of a 
sample in 10 minutes or less, when tested in accordance with the UN Manual of 
Tests and Criteria.

(b) 
Division 4.2 (Spontaneously Combustible Material).
For the purposes of this subchapter, 
spontaneously combustible material
(Division 4.2) means—
(1) 
A pyrophoric material.
A pyrophoric material is a liquid or solid that, even in small quantities and 
without an external ignition source, can ignite within five (5) minutes after 
coming in contact with air when tested according to UN Manual of Tests and 
Criteria.
(2) 
Self-heating material.
A self-heating material is a material that through a process where the gradual 
reaction of that substance with oxygen (in air) generates heat. If the rate of 
heat production exceeds the rate of heat loss, then the temperature of the 
substance will rise which, after an induction time, may lead to self-ignition 
and combustion. A material of this type which exhibits spontaneous ignition or 
if the temperature of the sample exceeds 200 °C (392 °F) during the 24-hour test 
period when tested in accordance with UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR; 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter), is classed as a Division 4.2 material.
(c) 
Division 4.3 (Dangerous when wet material).
For the purposes of this chapter, 
dangerous when wet material
(Division 4.3) means a material that, by contact with water, is liable to become 
spontaneously flammable or to give off flammable or toxic gas at a rate greater 
than 1 L per kilogram of the material, per hour, when tested in accordance with 
UN Manual of Tests and Criteria.

§ 173.128

Class 5, Division 5.2—Definitions and types.

(a) 
Definitions.
For the purposes of this subchapter, 
organic peroxide (Division 5.2)
means any organic compound containing oxygen (O) in the bivalent -O-O- structure 
and which may be considered a derivative of hydrogen peroxide, where one or more 
of the hydrogen atoms have been replaced by organic radicals, unless any of the 
following paragraphs applies:
(1) The material meets the definition of an explosive as prescribed in subpart C 
of this part, in which case it must be classed as an explosive;

(2) The material is forbidden from being offered for transportation according to 
§ 172.101 of this subchapter or § 173.21;

(3) The Associate Administrator has determined that the material does not 
present a hazard which is associated with a Division 5.2 material; or

(4) The material meets one of the following conditions:

(i) For materials containing no more than 1.0 percent hydrogen peroxide, the 
available oxygen, as calculated using the equation in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of 
this section, is not more than 1.0 percent, or

(ii) For materials containing more than 1.0 percent but not more than 7.0 
percent hydrogen peroxide, the available oxygen, content (O
a
) is not more than 0.5 percent, when determined using the equation:


EC13NO91.031


where, for a material containing k species of organic peroxides:

n
i
= number of -O-O- groups per molecule of the 
i
th species
c
i
= concentration (mass percent) of the 
i
th species
m
i
= molecular mass of the 
i
th species
(b) 
Generic types.
Division 5.2 organic peroxides are assigned to a generic system which consists 
of seven types. An organic peroxide identified by technical name in the Organic 
Peroxides Table in § 173.225 is assigned to a generic type in accordance with 
that table. Organic peroxides not identified in the Organic Peroxides table are 
assigned to generic types under the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section.
(1) 
Type A.
Organic peroxide type A is an organic peroxide which can detonate or deflagrate 
rapidly as packaged for transport. Transportation of type A organic peroxides is 
forbidden.
(2) 
Type B.
Organic peroxide type B is an organic peroxide which, as packaged for transport, 
neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly, but can undergo a thermal explosion.
(3) 
Type C.
Organic peroxide type C is an organic peroxide which, as packaged for transport, 
neither detonates nor deflagrates rapidly and cannot undergo a thermal 
explosion.
(4) 
Type D.
Organic peroxide type D is an organic peroxide which—
(i) Detonates only partially, but does not deflagrate rapidly and is not 
affected by heat when confined;

(ii) Does not detonate, deflagrates slowly, and shows no violent effect if 
heated when confined; or

(iii) Does not detonate or deflagrate, and shows a medium effect when heated 
under confinement.

(5) 
Type E.
Organic peroxide type E is an organic peroxide which neither detonates nor 
deflagrates and shows low, or no, effect when heated under confinement.
(6) 
Type F.
Organic peroxide type F is an organic peroxide which will not detonate in a 
cavitated state, does not deflagrate, shows only a low, or no, effect if heated 
when confined, and has low, or no, explosive power.
(7) 
Type G.
Organic peroxide type G is an organic peroxide which will not detonate in a 
cavitated state, will not deflagrate at all, shows no effect when heated under 
confinement, and shows no explosive power. A type G organic peroxide is not 
subject to the requirements of this subchapter for organic peroxides of Division 
5.2 provided that it is thermally stable (self-accelerating decomposition 
temperature is 50 °C (122 °F) or higher for a 50 kg (110 pounds) package). An 
organic peroxide meeting all characteristics of type G except thermal stability 
and requiring temperature control is classed as a type F, temperature control 
organic peroxide.
(c) 
Procedure for assigning an organic peroxide to a generic type.
An organic peroxide shall be assigned to a generic type based on—
(1) Its physical state (i.e., liquid or solid), in accordance with the 
definitions for liquid and solid in § 171.8 of this subchapter;

(2) A determination as to its control temperature and emergency temperature, if 
any, under the provisions of § 173.21(f); and

(3) Performance of the organic peroxide under the test procedures specified in 
the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), and 
the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section.

(d) 
Approvals.
(1) An organic peroxide must be approved, in writing, by the Associate 
Administrator, before being offered for transportation or transported, including 
assignment of a generic type and shipping description, except for—
(i) An organic peroxide which is identified by technical name in the Organic 
Peroxides Table in § 173.225(c);

(ii) A mixture of organic peroxides prepared according to § 173.225(b); or

(iii) An organic peroxide which may be shipped as a sample under the provisions 
of § 173.225(b).

(2) A person applying for an approval must submit all relevant data concerning 
physical state, temperature controls, and tests results or an approval issued 
for the organic peroxide by the competent authority of a foreign government.

(e) 
Tests.
The generic type for an organic peroxide shall be determined 
using the testing protocol from Figure 20.1(a) (Classification and Flow Chart 
Scheme for Organic Peroxides) from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see 
§ 171.7 of this subchapter).

§ 173.132

Class 6, Division 6.1—Definitions.

(a) For the purpose of this subchapter, 
poisonous material
(Division 6.1) means a material, other than a gas, which is known to be so toxic 
to humans as to afford a hazard to health during transportation, or which, in 
the absence of adequate data on human toxicity:
(1) Is presumed to be toxic to humans because it falls within any one of the 
following categories when tested on laboratory animals (whenever possible, 
animal test data that has been reported in the chemical literature should be 
used):

(i) 
Oral Toxicity.
A liquid or solid with an LD
50
for acute oral toxicity of not more than 300 mg/kg.
(ii) 
Dermal Toxicity.
A material with an LD
50
for acute dermal toxicity of not more than 1000 mg/kg.
(iii) 
Inhalation Toxicity.
(A) A dust or mist with an LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation of not more than 4 mg/L; or
(B) A material with a saturated vapor concentration in air at 20 °C (68 °F) 
greater than or equal to one-fifth of the LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation of vapors and with an LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation of vapors of not more than 5000 mL/m
3
; or
(2) Is an irritating material, with properties similar to tear gas, which causes 
extreme irritation, especially in confined spaces.

(b) For the purposes of this subchapter—

(1) LD
50
(median lethal dose) for acute oral toxicity is the statistically derived single 
dose of a substance that can be expected to cause death within 14 days in 50% of 
young adult albino rats when administered by the oral route. The LD
50
value is expressed in terms of mass of test substance per mass of test animal 
(mg/kg).
(2) LD
50
for acute dermal toxicity means that dose of the material which, administered by 
continuous contact for 24 hours with the shaved intact skin (avoiding abrading) 
of an albino rabbit, causes death within 14 days in half of the animals tested. 
The number of animals tested must be sufficient to give statistically valid 
results and be in conformity with good pharmacological practices. The result is 
expressed in mg/kg body mass.
(3) LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation means that concentration of vapor, mist, or 
dust which, administered by continuous inhalation for one hour to both male and 
female young adult albino rats, causes death within 14 days in half of the 
animals tested. If the material is administered to the animals as a dust or 
mist, more than 90 percent of the particles available for inhalation in the test 
must have a diameter of 10 microns or less if it is reasonably foreseeable that 
such concentrations could be encountered by a human during transport. The result 
is expressed in mg/L of air for dusts and mists or in mL/m
3
of air (parts per million) for vapors. See § 173.133(b) for LC
50
determination for mixtures and for limit tests.
(i) When provisions of this subchapter require the use of the LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation of dusts and mists based on a one-hour exposure 
and such data is not available, the LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation based on a four-hour exposure may be multiplied 
by four and the product substituted for the one-hour LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation.
(ii) When the provisions of this subchapter require the use of the LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation of vapors based on a one-hour exposure and such 
data is not available, the LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation based on a four-hour exposure may be multiplied 
by two and the product substituted for the 
one-hour LC
50
for acute toxicity on inhalation.
(iii) A solid substance should be tested if at least 10 percent of its total 
mass is likely to be dust in a respirable range, e.g. the aerodynamic diameter 
of that particle-fraction is 10 microns or less. A liquid substance should be 
tested if a mist is likely to be generated in a leakage of the transport 
containment. In carrying out the test both for solid and liquid substances, more 
than 90% (by mass) of a specimen prepared for inhalation toxicity testing must 
be in the respirable range as defined in this paragraph (b)(3)(iii).

(c) For purposes of classifying and assigning packing groups to mixtures 
possessing oral or dermal toxicity hazards according to the criteria in 
§ 173.133(a)(1), it is necessary to determine the acute LD
50
of the mixture. If a mixture contains more than one active constituent, one of 
the following methods may be used to determine the oral or dermal LD
50
of the mixture:
(1) Obtain reliable acute oral and dermal toxicity data on the actual mixture to 
be transported;

(2) If reliable, accurate data is not available, classify the formulation 
according to the most hazardous constituent of the mixture as if that 
constituent were present in the same concentration as the total concentration of 
all active constituents; or

(3) If reliable, accurate data is not available, apply the formula:


ER06MY97.000


where:

C = the % concentration of constituent A, B ... Z in the mixture;

T = the oral LD
50
values of constituent A, B ... Z;
T
M
= the oral LD
50
value of the mixture.

Note to formula in paragraph (
c
)(3):
This formula also may be used for dermal toxicities provided that this 
information is available on the same species for all constituents. The use of 
this formula does not take into account any potentiation or protective 
phenomena.

(d) The foregoing categories shall not apply if the Associate Administrator has 
determined that the physical characteristics of the material or its probable 
hazards to humans as shown by documented experience indicate that the material 
will not cause serious sickness or death.

§ 173.133

Assignment of packing group and hazard zones for Division 6.1 materials.

(a) The packing group of Division 6.1 materials shall be as assigned in column 5 
of the § 172.101 table. When the § 172.101 table provides more than one packing 
group or hazard zone for a hazardous material, the packing group and hazard zone 
shall be determined by applying the following criteria:

(1) The packing group assignment for routes of administration other than 
inhalation of vapors shall be in accordance with the following table:

V ≥.2 LC
50
; LC

3
; and the criteria for Packing Groups I and II, are not met.

Note 1:
V is the saturated vapor concentration in air of the material in mL/m
3
at 20 °C and standard atmospheric pressure.

Note 2:
A liquid in Division 6.1 meeting criteria for Packing Group I, Hazard Zones A or 
B stated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section is a material poisonous by 
inhalation subject to the additional hazard communication requirements in 
§§ 172.203(m), 172.313 and table 1 of § 172.504(e) of this subchapter.
(ii) These criteria are represented graphically in Figure 1:



EC02MR91.063

(3) When the packing group determined by applying these criteria is different 
for two or more (oral, dermal or inhalation) routes of administration, the 
packing group assigned to the material shall be that indicated for the highest 
degree of toxicity for any of the routes of administration.

(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the packing group and 
hazard zone of a tear gas substance is as assigned in column 5 of the § 172.101 
table.

(b) The packing group and hazard zone for Division 6.1 mixtures that are 
poisonous (toxic) by inhalation may be determined by one of the following 
methods:

(1) Where LC
50
data is available on each of the poisonous (toxic) substances comprising the 
mixture—
(i) The LC
50
of the mixture is estimated using the formula:

ER07SE04.000


where

f
i
= mole fraction of the i
th
component substance of the liquid.
LC
50

i
= mean lethal concentration of the i
th
component substance in mL/m
3

(ii) The volatility of each component substance is estimated using the formula:


ER28SE01.023


where:

P
i
= partial pressure of the i
th
component substance in kPa at 20 °C and one atmospheric pressure. Pi may be 
calculated according to Raoult's Law using appropriate activity coefficients. 
Where activity coefficients are not available, the coefficient may be assumed to 
be 1.0.
(iii) The ratio of the volatility to the LC
50
is calculated using the formula:

ER07SE04.001

(iv) Using the calculated values LC
50
(mixture) and R, the packing group for the mixture is determined as follows:


Packaging group
(hazard zone)

Ratio of volatility and LC
50


I (Hazard Zone A)

R ≥500 and LC
50
(mixture) ≤200 mL/m
3
.

I (Hazard Zone B)

R ≥10 and LC
50
(mixture) ≤1000 mL/m
3
; and the criteria for Packing Group I, Hazard Zone A are not met.

II

R ≥1 and LC
50
(mixture) ≤3000 mL/m
3
; and the criteria for Packing Group I, Hazard Zones A and B are not met.

III

R ≥
1/5
and LC
50
(mixture) ≤5000 mL/m
3
; and the criteria for Packing Group I, Hazard Zones A and B and Packing Group 
II are not met.
(2) In the absence of LC
50
data on the poisonous (toxic) constituent substances, the mixture may be 
assigned a packing group and hazard zone based on the following simplified 
threshold toxicity tests. When these threshold tests are used, the most 
restrictive packing group and hazard zone must be determined and used for the 
transportation of the mixture.
(i) A mixture is assigned to Packing Group I, Hazard Zone A only if both the 
following criteria are met:

(A) A sample of the liquid mixture is vaporized and diluted with air to create a 
test atmosphere of 200 mL/m
3
vaporized mixture in air. Ten albino rats (five male and five female) are 
exposed to the test atmosphere as determined by an analytical method appropriate 
for the material being classified for one hour and observed for fourteen days.

§ 173.134

Class 6, Division 6.2—Definitions and exceptions.

(a) 
Definitions and classification criteria.
For the purposes of this subchapter, the following definitions and 
classification criteria apply to Division 6.2 materials.
(1) 
Division 6.2 (Infectious substance)
means a material known or reasonably expected to contain a pathogen. A pathogen 
is a microorganism (including bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, parasites, fungi) 
or other agent, such as a proteinaceous infectious particle (prion), that can 
cause disease in humans or animals. An infectious substance must be assigned the 
identification number UN 2814, UN 2900, UN 3373, or UN 3291 as appropriate, and 
must be assigned to one of the following categories:
(i) 
Category A:
An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability or 
life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when 
exposure to it occurs. An exposure occurs when an infectious substance is 
released outside of its protective packaging, resulting in physical contact with 
humans or animals. A Category A infectious substance must be assigned to 
identification number UN 2814 or UN 2900, as appropriate. Assignment to UN 2814 
or UN 2900 must be based on the known medical history or symptoms of the source 
patient or animal, endemic 
local conditions, or professional judgment concerning the individual 
circumstances of the source human or animal.
(ii)

Class 8—Definitions.

(a) For the purpose of this subchapter, “corrosive material” (Class 8) means a 
liquid or solid that causes full thickness destruction of human skin at the site 
of contact within a specified period of time. A liquid, or a solid which may 
become liquid during transportation, that has a severe corrosion rate on steel 
or aluminum based on the criteria in § 173.137(c)(2) is also a corrosive 
material. Whenever practical, 
in vitro
test methods authorized in § 173.137 of this part or historical data authorized 
in paragraph (c) of this section should be used to determine whether a material 
is corrosive.
(b) If human experience or other data indicate that the hazard of a material is 
greater or less than indicated by the results of the tests specified in 
paragraph (a) of this section, PHMSA may revise its classification or make the 
determination that the material is not subject to the requirements of this 
subchapter.

(c) Skin corrosion test data produced no later than September 30, 1995, using 
the procedures of part 173, appendix A, in effect on September 30, 1995 (see 49 
CFR part 173, appendix A, revised as of

§ 173.137

Class 8—Assignment of packing group.

The packing group of a Class 8 material is indicated in Column 5 of the 
§ 172.101 Table. When the § 172.101 Table provides more than one packing group 
for a Class 8 material, the packing group must be determined using data obtained 
from tests conducted in accordance with the OECD Guideline for the Testing of 
Chemicals, Number 435, “
In Vitro
Membrane Barrier Test Method for Skin Corrosion” (IBR, 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter) or Number 404, “Acute Dermal Irritation/Corrosion” 
(IBR, 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter). A material that is determined not to be corrosive 
in accordance with OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals, Number 430, “
In Vitro
Skin Corrosion: Transcutaneous Electrical Resistance Test (TER)” (IBR, 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter) or Number 431, “
In Vitro
Skin Corrosion: Human Skin Model Test” (IBR, 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter) may be considered not to be corrosive to human skin 
for the purposes of this subchapter without further testing. However, a material 
determined to be corrosive in accordance with Number 430 or Number 431 must be 
further tested using Number 435 or Number 404. The packing group assignment 
using data obtained from tests conducted in accordance with OECD Guideline 
Number 404 or Number 435 must be as follows:
(a) 
Packing Group I.
Materials that cause full thickness destruction of intact skin tissue within an 
observation period of up to 60 minutes starting after the exposure time of three 
minutes or less.
(b) 
Packing Group II.
Materials other than those meeting Packing Group I criteria that cause full 
thickness destruction of intact skin tissue within an observation period of up 
to 14 days starting after the exposure time of more than three minutes but not 
more than 60 minutes.
(c) 
Packing Group III.
Materials, other than those meeting Packing Group I or II criteria—
(1) That cause full thickness destruction of intact skin tissue within an 
observation period of up to 14 days starting after the exposure time of more 
than 60 minutes but not more than 4 hours; or

(2) That do not cause full thickness destruction of intact skin tissue but 
exhibit a corrosion on either steel or aluminum surfaces exceeding 6.25 mm (0.25 
inch) a year at a test temperature of 55 °C (130 °F) when tested on both 
materials. The corrosion may be determined in accordance with the UN Manual of 
Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter) or other equivalent 
test methods. 


Note to § 173.137:

When an initial test on either a steel or aluminum surface indicates the 
material being tested is corrosive, the follow up test on the other surface is 
not required.

§ 173.166

Safety devices.

For the purpose of this section, safety devices are articles which contain 
pyrotechnic substances or hazardous materials of other classes and are used in 
vehicles, vessels or aircraft to enhance safety to persons. Examples are: air 
bag inflators, air bag modules, seat-belt pretensioners and pyromechanical 
devices. Pyromechanical devices are assembled components for tasks such as but 
not limited to separation, locking, release-and-drive or occupant restraint. The 
term includes “Safety devices, pyrotechnic.”

(a) 
Definitions.
An 
air bag inflator
(consisting of a casing containing an igniter, a booster material, a gas 
generant and, in some cases, a pressure receptacle (cylinder)) is a gas 
generator used to inflate an air bag in a supplemental restraint system in a 
motor vehicle. An 
air bag module
is the air bag inflator plus an inflatable bag assembly. A 
seat-belt pretensioner
contains similar hazardous materials and is used in the operation of a seat-belt 
restraining system in a motor vehicle.
(b) 
Classification.
(1) Safety devices, excluding those which contain flammable or toxic gases or 
mixtures thereof, may be classed as Class 9 (UN3268) if the safety device, or if 
more than a single safety device is involved then the representative of the 
maximum parameters of each design type, is examined and successfully tested by a 
person or agency who is authorized by the Associate Administrator to perform 
examination and testing of explosives under § 173.56(b)(1), and who:

(i) Does not manufacture or market explosives or safety devices, is not owned in 
whole or in part, or is not financially dependent upon any entity that 
manufactures or markets explosives or safety devices;

(ii) Performs all examination and testing in accordance with the applicable 
requirements as specified in special provision 160 (see § 172.102 of this 
subchapter); and

(iii) Maintains records in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.

(iv) By adhering to all the provisions specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section, a Class 9 (UN3268) air bag inflator, air bag module or seat-belt 
pretensioner design is not required to be submitted to the Associate 
Administrator for approval or assigned an EX number. All other Class 9 (UN3268) 
safety device designs are required to be submitted to the Associate 
Administrator for approval and assigned an EX number;

(2) A safety device may be classed as Division 1.4G if the maximum parameters of 
each design type have been examined and successfully tested by a person or 
agency who is authorized by the Associate Administrator to perform such 
examination and testing of explosives under § 173.56(b)(1). As a Class 1 
explosive, the manufacturer must submit to the Associate Administrator a report 
of the examination and assignment of a recommended shipping description, 
division, and compatibility group, and if the Associate Administrator finds the 
approval request meets the regulatory criteria, the explosive may be approved in 
writing and assigned an EX number; or

(3) The manufacturer has submitted an application, including a classification 
issued by the competent authority of a foreign government to the Associate 
Administrator, and received written notification from the Associate 
Administrator that the device has been approved for transportation and assigned 
an EX number.

(c) 
EX numbers.
(1) When a safety device is classed and approved as a Division 1.4G and offered 
for transportation, the shipping paper must contain the EX number or product 
code for each approved device in association with the basic description required 
by § 172.202(a) of this subchapter. Product codes must be traceable to the 
specific EX number assigned to the device by the Associate Administrator. 
Further, if the EX number or product code is contained on the shipping paper 
then it is not required to be marked on the outside package.
(2) A safety device, when classed as a Class 9 (UN3268), is excepted from the EX 
number, or product code shipping paper requirements of paragraph (c) of this 
section.

(d) 
Exceptions.
(1) A safety device that is classed as a Class 9 (UN3268) under the terms of 
paragraph (b)(1) of this section and is installed in a motor vehicle, aircraft, 
boat or other transport conveyance or its completed components, such as steering 
columns or door panels, is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter. A 
safety device that has been classed as a Division 1.4G and approved by the 
Associate Administrator and is installed in a motor vehicle, aircraft, boat or 
other transport conveyance or its completed components, such as steering columns 
or door panels, is not subject to the requirements of this subchapter.
(2) An air bag module containing an inflator that has been previously approved 
by the Associate Administrator for transportation is not required to be 
submitted for further examination or approval. For classifications granted after 
July 30, 2013, if the Class 9 designation for the inflator is contingent upon 
packaging or other special means specified by the authorized testing agency, the 
modules must be tested and certified separately to determine if they can be 
shipped as “UN3268, Safety Devices, 9, PG III”.

(3) An air bag module containing an inflator that has previously been approved 
by the Associate Administrator as a Division 2.2 material is not required to be 
submitted for further examination to be reclassed as a Class 9 material.

(4)

or cargo aircraft, a serviceable safety device classed as either Class 9 
(UN3268) or Division 1.4G removed from a motor vehicle that was manufactured as 
required for use in the 
United States may be offered for transportation and transported without 
compliance with the shipping paper requirement prescribed in paragraph (c) of 
this section. However, when these articles are shipped to a recycling facility, 
the word “Recycled” must be entered on the shipping paper immediately after the 
basic description prescribed in § 172.202 of this subchapter. No more than one 
device is authorized in the packaging prescribed in paragraph (e)(1), (2) or (3) 
of this section. The device must be cushioned and secured within the package to 
prevent movement during transportation.
(5) An air bag inflator, air bag module, or seat-belt pretensioner that was 
classed and approved for transportation prior to January 1, 2015 may continue to 
be transported under the terms of the existing approval, using the appropriate 
proper shipping name “Safety Devices” or “Safety Devices, Pyrotechnic” based on 
the classification of the device as assigned by PHMSA or the authorized person 
or agency that examined and tested the design type.

(a) Effective January 1, 2013, a “consumer commodity” (see § 171.8 of this 
subchapter) when offered for transportation by aircraft may only include 
articles or substances of Class 2 (non-toxic aerosols only), Class 3 (Packing 
Group II and III only), Division 6.1 (Packing Group III only), UN3077, UN3082, 
UN3175, UN3334, and UN3335, provided such materials do not have a subsidiary 
risk and are authorized aboard a passenger-carrying aircraft. Consumer 
commodities are excepted from the specification outer packaging requirements of 
this subchapter. Packages prepared under the requirements of this section are 
excepted from labeling and shipping papers when transported by highway or rail. 
Except as indicated in § 173.24(i), each completed package must conform to 
§§ 173.24 and 173.24a of this subchapter. Additionally, except for the pressure 
differential requirements in § 173.27(c), the requirements of § 173.27 do not 
apply to packages prepared in accordance with this section. Packages prepared 
under the requirements of this section may 
be offered for transportation and transported by all modes. As applicable, the 
following apply:
(1) 
Inner and outer packaging quantity limits.
(i) Non-toxic aerosols, as defined in § 171.8 of this subchapter and constructed 
in accordance with § 173.306 of this part, in non-refillable, non-metal 
containers not exceeding 120 mL (4 fluid ounces) each, or in non-refillable 
metal containers not exceeding 820 mL (28 ounces) each, except that flammable 
aerosols may not exceed 500 mL (16.9 ounces) each;
(ii) Liquids, in inner packagings not exceeding 500 mL (16.9 ounces) each. 
Liquids must not completely fill an inner packaging at 55 °C;

(iii) Solids, in inner packagings not exceeding 500 g (1.0 pounds) each; or

(iv) Any combination thereof not to exceed 30 kg (66 pounds) gross weight as 
prepared for shipment.

(2) 
Closures.
Friction-type closures must be secured by positive means. The body and closure 
of any packaging must be constructed so as to be able to adequately resist the 
effects of temperature and vibration occurring in conditions normally incident 
to air transportation. The closure device must be so designed that it is 
unlikely that it can be incorrectly or incompletely closed.
(3) 
Absorbent material.
Inner packagings must be tightly packaged in strong outer packagings. Absorbent 
and cushioning material must not react dangerously with the contents of inner 
packagings. Glass or earthenware inner packagings containing liquids of Class 3 
or Division 6.1, sufficient absorbent material must be provided to absorb the 
entire contents of the largest inner packaging contained in the outer packaging. 
Absorbent material is not required if the glass or earthenware inner packagings 
are sufficiently protected as packaged for transport that it is unlikely a 
failure would occur and, if a failure did occur, that it would be unlikely that 
the contents would leak from the outer packaging.
(4) 
Drop test capability.
Breakable inner packagings (
e.g.,
glass, earthenware, or brittle plastic) must be packaged to prevent failure 
under conditions normally incident to transport. Packages of consumer 
commodities as prepared for transport must be capable of withstanding a 1.2 m 
drop on solid concrete in the position most likely to cause damage. In order to 
pass the test, the outer packaging must not exhibit any damage liable to affect 
safety during transport and there must be no leakage from the inner 
packaging(s).
(5) 
Stack test capability.
Packages of consumer commodities must be capable of withstanding, without 
failure or leakage of any inner packaging and without any significant reduction 
in effectiveness, a force applied to the top surface for a duration of 24 hours 
equivalent to the total weight of identical packages if stacked to a height of 
3.0 m (including the test sample).
(b) When offered for transportation by aircraft:

(1) Packages prepared under the requirements of this section are to be marked as 
a limited quantity in accordance with § 172.315(b)(1) and labeled as a Class 9 
article or substance, as appropriate, in accordance with subpart E of part 172 
of this subchapter; and

(2) Pressure differential capability: Except for UN3082, inner packagings 
intended to contain liquids must be capable of meeting the pressure differential 
requirements (75 kPa) prescribed in § 173.27(c) of this part. The capability of 
a packaging to withstand an internal pressure without leakage that produces the 
specified pressure differential should be determined by successfully testing 
design samples or prototypes.

§ 173.225

Packaging requirements and other provisions for organic peroxides.

(a) 
General.
When the § 172.101 table specifies that an organic peroxide must be packaged 
under this section, the organic peroxide must be packaged and offered for 
transportation in accordance with the provisions of this section. Each packaging 
must conform to the general requirements of subpart B of part 173 and to the 
applicable requirements of part 178 of this subchapter. Non-bulk packagings must 
meet Packing Group II performance levels. To avoid unnecessary confinement, 
metallic non-bulk packagings meeting Packing Group I are not authorized. No used 
material, other than production residues or regrind from the same production 
process, may be used in plastic packagings. Organic peroxides that require 
temperature control are subject to the provisions of 
§ 173.21(f). When an IBC or bulk packaging is authorized and meets the 
requirements of paragraph (f) or (h) of this section, respectively, lower 
control temperatures than those specified for non-bulk packaging may be 
required. An organic peroxide not identified in paragraph (c), (e), or (g) of 
this section by technical name, or not assigned to a generic type in accordance 
with the provisions in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, must conform to the 
provisions of paragraph (c) of § 173.128.
(b) 
New organic peroxides, formulations and samples.
(1) Except as provided for samples in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, no 
person may offer for transportation an organic peroxide that is not identified 
by technical name in the Organic Peroxides Table, Organic Peroxide IBC Table, or 
the Organic Peroxide Portable Tank Table of this section, or a formulation of 
one or more organic peroxides that are identified by technical name in one of 
those tables, unless the organic peroxide is assigned a generic type and 
shipping description and is approved by the Associate Administrator under the 
provisions of § 173.128(d) of this subchapter.
(2) 
Samples.
Samples of new organic peroxides or new formulations of organic peroxides 
identified in the Organic Peroxides Table in paragraph (c) of this section, for 
which complete test data are not available, and that are to be transported for 
further testing or product evaluation, may be assigned an appropriate shipping 
description for organic peroxide Type C, packaged and offered for 
transportation, under the following conditions:
(i) Data available to the person offering the material for transportation must 
indicate that the sample would pose a level of hazard no greater than that of an 
organic peroxide Type B and that the control temperature, if any, is 
sufficiently low to prevent any dangerous decomposition and sufficiently high to 
prevent any dangerous phase separation;

(ii) The sample must be packaged in accordance with packing method OP2, for a 
liquid or solid, respectively;

(iii) Packages of the organic peroxide may be offered for transportation and 
transported in a quantity not to exceed 10 kg (22 pounds) per transport vehicle; 
and

(iv) One of the following shipping descriptions must be assigned:

(A) Organic peroxide Type C, liquid, 5.2, UN 3103;

(B) Organic peroxide Type C, solid, 5.2, UN 3104;

(C) Organic peroxide Type C, liquid, temperature controlled, 5.2, UN 3113; or

(D) Organic peroxide Type C, solid, temperature controlled, 5.2, UN 3114.

(3) 
Mixtures.
Mixtures of organic peroxides individually identified in the Organic Peroxides 
Table in paragraph (c) of this section may be classified as the same type of 
organic peroxide as that of the most dangerous component and be transported 
under the conditions for transportation given for this type. If the stable 
components form a thermally less stable mixture, the SADT of the mixture must be 
determined and the new control and emergency temperature derived under the 
provisions of § 173.21(f).
(c) 
Organic peroxides table.
The following Organic Peroxides Table specifies by technical name those organic 
peroxides that are authorized for transportation and not subject to the approval 
provisions of § 173.128 of this part. An organic peroxide identified by 
technical name in the following table is authorized for transportation only if 
it conforms to all applicable provisions of the table. The column headings of 
the Organic Peroxides Table are as follows:
(1) 
Technical name.
The first column specifies the technical name.
(2) 
ID number.
The second column specifies the identification (ID) number which is used to 
identify the proper shipping name in the § 172.101 table. The word “EXEMPT” 
appearing in the column denotes that the material is not regulated as an organic 
peroxide.
(3) 
Concentration of organic peroxide.
The third column specifies concentration (mass percent) limitations, if any, in 
mixtures or solutions for the organic peroxide. Limitations are given as 
minimums, maximums, or a range, as appropriate. A range includes the lower and 
upper limits (
i.e.
, “53-100” means from, and including, 53% to, and including 100%). See 
introductory paragraph of § 172.203(k) of this subchapter 
for additional description requirements for an organic peroxide that may qualify 
for more than one generic listing, depending on its concentration.
(4) 
Concentration of diluents.
The fourth column specifies the type and concentration (mass percent) of diluent 
or inert solid, when required. Other types and concentrations of diluents may be 
used if approved by the Associate Administrator.
(i) The required mass percent of “Diluent type A” is specified in column 4a. A 
diluent type A is an organic liquid that does not detrimentally affect the 
thermal stability or increase the hazard of the organic peroxide and with a 
boiling point not less than 150 °C at atmospheric pressure. Type A diluents may 
be used for desensitizing all organic peroxides.

(ii) The required mass percent of “Diluent type B” is specified in column 4b. A 
diluent type B is an organic liquid which is compatible with the organic 
peroxide and which has a boiling point, at atmospheric pressure, of less than 
150 °C (302 °F) but at least 60 °C (140 °F), and a flash point greater than 5 °C 
(41 °F). Type B diluents may be used for desensitizing all organic peroxides, 
when specified in the organic peroxide tables, provided that the boiling point 
is at least 60 °C (140 °F) above the SADT of the peroxide in a 50 kg (110 lbs) 
package. A type A diluent may be used to replace a type B diluent in equal 
concentration.

(iii) The required mass percent of “Inert solid” is specified in column 4c. An 
inert solid is a solid that does not detrimentally affect the thermal stability 
or hazard of the organic peroxide.

(5) 
Concentration of water.
Column 5 specifies, in mass percent, the minimum amount of water, if any, which 
must be in formulation.
(6) 
Packing method.
Column 6 specifies the highest packing method (largest packaging capacity) 
authorized for the organic peroxide. Lower numbered packing methods (smaller 
packaging capacities) are also authorized. For example, if OP3 is specified, 
then OP2 and OP1 are also authorized. The Table of Packing Methods in paragraph 
(d) of this section defines the non-bulk packing methods.
(7) 
Temperatures.
Column 7a specifies the control temperature. Column 7b specifies the emergency 
temperature. Temperatures are specified only when temperature controls are 
required. (See § 173.21(f)).
(8) 
Notes.
Column 8 specifies other applicable provisions, as set forth in notes following 
the table.

(h) 
Bulk packagings other than IBCs.
The following bulk packagings are authorized, subject to the conditions and 
limitations of this section, if the organic peroxide is listed in the Organic 
Peroxide Portable Tank Table and bulk packagings are authorized, or if the 
organic peroxide is specifically authorized for transport in a bulk packaging by 
this paragraph (h), and the bulk packaging conforms to the requirements of this 
subchapter:
(1) 
Rail cars.
Class DOT 103, 104, 105, 109, 111, 112, 114, 115, or 120 fusion-weld tank car 
tanks are authorized. DOT 103W, 111A60F1 and 111A60W1 tank car tanks must have 
bottom outlets effectively sealed from inside. Gauging devices are required on 
DOT 103W tank car tanks. Riveted tank car tanks are not authorized.
(2) 
Cargo tanks.
Specification MC 307, MC 310, MC 311, MC 312, DOT 407, and DOT 412 cargo tank 
motor vehicles with a tank design pressure of at least 172 kPa (25 psig) are 
authorized.
(3) 
Portable tanks.
The following requirements apply to portable tanks intended for the transport of 
organic peroxides or self-reactive substances. DOT 51, 57, IM 101 portable 
tanks, and UN portable tanks that conform to the requirements of paragraph (g) 
of this section, are authorized. Type F organic peroxide or self-reactive 
substance formulations other than those indicated in the Organic Peroxide 
Portable Tank Table may be transported in portable tanks if approved by the 
Associate Administrator. The following conditions also apply:
(i) The portable tank must be designed for a test pressure of at least 0.4 MPa 
(4 bar).

(ii) The portable tank must be fitted with temperature-sensing devices.

(iii) The portable tank must be fitted with pressure relief devices and 
emergency-relief devices. Vacuum-relief devices may also be used. Pressure 
relief devices must operate at pressures determined according to both the 
properties of the hazardous material and the construction characteristics of the 
portable tank. Fusible elements are not allowed in the shell.

(iv) The pressure relief devices must consist of reclosing devices fitted to 
prevent significant build-up within the portable tank of the decomposition 
products and vapors released at a temperature of 50 °C (122 °F). The capacity 
and start-to-discharge pressure of the relief devices must be in accordance with 
the applicable requirements of this subchapter specified for the portable tank. 
The pressure relief devices must not allow liquid to escape in the event the 
portable tank is overturned in a loaded condition.

(v)(A) The emergency-relief devices may be of the reclosing or frangible types, 
or a combination of the two, designed to vent all the decomposition products and 
vapors evolved during a period of not less than one hour of complete fire 
engulfment as calculated by the following formula:


ER20DE04.002


Where:

q = heat absorption (W)

A = wetted area (m
2
)
F = insulation factor (−)

(B) Insulation factor (F) in the formula in paragraph (h)(3)(v)(A) of this 
section equals 1 for non-insulated vessels and for insulated vessels F is 
calculated using the following formula:


ER20DE04.003


Where:

U = K/L = heat transfer coefficient of the insulation (W·m
−2
·K
−1
); where K = heat conductivity of insulation layer (W·m
−1
·K
−1
), and L = thickness of insulation layer (m).
T
PO
= temperature of material at relieving conditions (K).
(vi) The start-to-discharge pressure of emergency-relief devices must be higher 
than that specified for the pressure relief devices in paragraph (h)(3)(iv) of 
this section. The emergency-relief devices must be sized and designed in such a 
way that the maximum pressure in the shell never exceeds the test pressure of 
the portable tank. 


Note to paragraph (
h
)(3)(
vi
):
An example of a method to determine the size of emergency-relief devices is 
given in Appendix 5 of the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria (IBR, see § 171.7 of 
this subchapter). A second example of a test method for venting sizing is given 
in the American Institute of Chemical 
Engineers Process Safety Progress Journal, June 2002 issue (Vol. 21, No. 2) 
(Informational materials not requiring incorporation by reference, see 
§ 171.7(b)).
(vii) For insulated portable tanks, the capacity and setting of emergency-relief 
devices must be determined assuming a loss of insulation from 1% of the surface 
area.

(viii) Vacuum-relief devices and reclosing devices on portable tanks used for 
flammable hazardous materials must be provided with flame arresters. Any 
reduction of the relief capacity caused by the flame arrester must be taken into 
account and the appropriate relief capacity must be provided.

(ix) Service equipment such as devices and external piping must be designed and 
constructed so that no hazardous material remains in them after filling the 
portable tank.

(x) Portable tanks may be either insulated or protected by a sun-shield. If the 
SADT of the hazardous material in the portable tank is 55 °C (131 °F) or less, 
the portable tank must be completely insulated. The outer surface must be 
finished in white or bright metal.

(xi) The degree of filling must not exceed 90% at 15 °C (59 °F).

(xii) DOT 57 metal portable tanks are authorized only for those materials or 
mixtures of two or more materials that are provided with a reference to Note 9 
in Column 8 of the Organic Peroxide Table, found in paragraph (c) of this 
section. DOT 57 portable tanks must conform to the venting requirements of 
paragraph (f) of this section. These portable tanks are not subject to any other 
requirements of paragraph (h) of this section.

(4) For tertiary butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP), each tank car, cargo tank or 
portable tank must contain 7.6 cm (3.0 inches) low density polyethylene (PE) 
saddles having a melt index of at least 0.2 grams per 10 minutes (for example 
see, ASTM D1238, condition E) as part of the lading, with a ratio of PE to TBHP 
over a range of 0.008 to 0.012 by mass. Alternatively, plastic or metal 
containers equipped with fusible plugs having a melting point between 69 °C (156 
°F) and 71 °C (160 °F) and filled with a sufficient quantity of water to dilute 
the TBHP to 65% or less by mass may be used. The PE saddles must be visually 
inspected after each trip and, at a minimum, once every 12 months, and replaced 
when discoloration, fracture, severe deformation, or other indication of change 
is noted.

§ 173.230

Fuel cell cartridges containing hazardous material.

(a) 
Requirements for Fuel Cell Cartridges.
Fuel cell cartridges, including when contained in or packed with equipment, must 
be designed and constructed to prevent fuel leakage under normal conditions of 
transportation. Fuel cell cartridge design types using liquids as fuels must 
pass an internal pressure test at a gauge pressure of 100 kPa (15 psig) without 
leakage. Except for fuel cell cartridges containing hydrogen in metal hydride 
which must be in conformance with paragraph (d) of this section, each fuel cell 
cartridge design type including when contained in or packed with equipment, must 
pass a 1.2 meter (3.9 feet) drop test onto an unyielding surface in the 
orientation most likely to result in the failure of the containment system with 
no loss of contents. Fuel cell cartridges installed in or integral to a fuel 
cell system are regarded as contained in equipment. Fuel cell cartridges 
containing a Division 2.1, Division 4.3 or Class 8 material must meet the 
following additional requirements.

(b) A fuel cell cartridge designed to contain a Division 4.3 or a Class 8 
material may contain an activator provided it is fitted with two independent 
means of preventing unintended mixing with the fuel during transport.

(c) Each fuel cell cartridge designed to contain a liquefied flammable gas must:

(1) Be capable of withstanding, without leakage or bursting, a pressure of at 
least two times the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 55 °C (131 °F);

(2) Contain no more than 200 mL of liquefied flammable gas with a vapor pressure 
not exceeding 1,000 kPa (150 psig) at 55 °C (131 °F); and

(3) Pass the hot water bath test prescribed in accordance with 
§ 173.306(a)(3)(v).

(d) Each fuel cell cartridge designed to contain hydrogen in a metal hydride 
must conform to the following:

(1) Each fuel cell cartridge must have a water capacity less than or equal to 
120 mL (4 fluid ounces).

(2) Each fuel cell cartridge must be a design type that has been subjected, 
without leakage or bursting, a pressure of at least two times the design 
pressure of the cartridge at 55 °C (131 °F) or 200 kPa (30 psig) more than the 
design pressure of the cartridge at 55 °C (131 °F), whichever is greater. The 
pressure at which the test is conducted is referred to as the “minimum shell 
burst pressure.” The pressure within the fuel cell cartridge must not exceed 5 
MPa (725 psig) at 55 °C (131 °F).

(3) Each fuel cell cartridge must be filled in accordance with the procedure 
provided by the manufacturer. The manufacturer must provide the following 
information with each fuel cell cartridge:

(i) Inspection procedures to be carried out before initial filling and before 
refilling of the fuel cell cartridge;

(ii) Safety precautions and potential hazards to be aware of;

(iii) A method of determining when the rated capacity has been achieved;

(iv) Minimum and maximum pressure range;

(v) Minimum and maximum temperature range; and

(vi) Any other requirements to be met for initial filling and refilling 
including the type of equipment to be used.

(4) Each fuel cell cartridge must be permanently marked with the following 
information:

(i) The rated charging pressure in megapascals (MPa);

(ii) The manufacturer's serial number of the fuel cell cartridges or unique 
identification number; and

(iii) The expiration date based on the maximum service life (yyyy/mm).

(5) 
Design type tests:
Each fuel cell cartridge design type must be subjected to and pass the following 
tests (this includes cartridges integral to a fuel cell):
(i) 
Drop test.
A 1.8 m (5.9 feet) drop test onto an unyielding surface must be performed. There 
must be no leakage. Leakage must be determined using a soap bubble solution or 
other equivalent means on all possible leak locations, when the fuel cell 
cartridge is charged to its rated charging pressure. The fuel cell cartridge 
must then be hydrostatically pressurized to destruction. The burst pressure must 
be greater than 85% of the minimum shell burst pressure. The drop must be 
performed in the following four different orientations:
(A) Vertically, on the end containing the shut-off valve assembly;

(B) Vertically, on the end opposite to the shut-off valve assembly;

(C) Horizontally, onto a steel apex with a diameter of 3.8 cm (9.7 in), with the 
steel apex in the upward position; and

(D) At a 45° angle on the end containing the shut-off valve assembly.

(ii) 
Fire test.
A fuel cell cartridge filled to rated capacity (with hydrogen) must be subjected 
to a fire engulfment test. The cartridge design (including design types with an 
integral vent feature) is deemed to pass the fire test if:
(A) The internal pressure vents to zero gauge pressure without the rupture of 
the cartridge; or

(B) The cartridge withstands the fire for a minimum of 20 minutes without 
rupture.

(iii) 
Hydrogen cycling test.
A fuel cell cartridge must be subjected to a hydrogen cycling test to ensure 
that the design stress limits are not exceeded during use. The fuel cell 
cartridge must be 
cycled from not more than 5% rated hydrogen capacity to not less than 95% rated 
hydrogen capacity and back to not more than 5% rated hydrogen capacity. The 
rated charging pressure must be used for charging and temperatures must be 
within the operating temperature range. The cycling must be continued for at 
least 100 cycles. Following the cycling test the fuel cell cartridge must be 
charged and the water volume displaced by the cartridge must be measured. The 
cartridge design is deemed to pass the test if the water volume displaced by the 
cycled cartridge does not exceed the water volume displaced by an uncycled 
cartridge charged to 95% rated capacity and pressurized to 75% of its minimum 
shell burst pressure.
(6) 
Production leak test.
Each fuel cell cartridge must be tested for leaks at 15 °C ±5 °C (59 °F ±9 °F) 
while pressurized to its rated charging pressure. There must be no leakage. 
Leakage must be determined using a soap bubble solution or other equivalent 
means on all possible leak locations.
(e) The following packagings are authorized provided the general packaging 
requirements subpart B of part 173 of this subchapter are met:

(1) For fuel cell cartridges, rigid packagings conforming to the requirements of 
part 178 of this subchapter at the packing group II performance level; and

(2) Strong outer packagings for fuel cell cartridges contained in equipment or 
packed with equipment. Large equipment containing fuel cell cartridges may be 
transported unpackaged if the equipment provides an equivalent level of 
protection.

(i) Fuel cell cartridges packed with equipment must be packed with cushioning 
material or divider(s) or inner packagings so that the fuel cell cartridges are 
protected against damage that may be caused by the shifting or placement of the 
equipment and cartridges within the packaging.

(ii) For fuel cell cartridges contained in equipment, the entire fuel cell 
system must be protected against short circuits and unintentional activation. 
The equipment must be securely cushioned in the outer packaging.

(f) For transportation by aircraft, the following additional provisions apply:

cargo tank) having a capacity not greater than 5678 L (1500 gallons) with an 
integral heating apparatus used for melting various bituminous products such as 
asphalt. Kettles used for the transport of asphalt or bitumen are subject to the 
following requirements:
(1) 
Low stability kettles.
Kettles with a ratio of track-width to fully loaded center of gravity (CG) 
height less than 2.5 must meet all requirements of paragraph (g) of this section 
(track-width is the distance measured between the outer edge of the kettle 
tires; CG height is measured perpendicular from the road surface).

requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.
(ii) Kettles with a total capacity of 2650 L (700 gallons) or more and a ratio 
of track-width to fully loaded CG height of 2.5 or more are excepted from the 
“substantially leak tight” requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of this section and 
the rollover protection requirements of paragraph (g)(6) of this section if 
closures meet the requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section.

(iii) Closures must be securely closed during transportation. Closures also must 
be designed to prevent opening and the expulsion of lading in a rollover 
accident.

(f) 
Other bulk packagings:
Bulk packagings, other than those specified in paragraphs (a) through (e) of 
this section, which are used for the transport of elevated temperature 
materials, must conform to all requirements of paragraph (g) of this section on 
or after October 1, 1993.
(g) 
General requirements.
Bulk packagings authorized or used for transport of elevated temperature 
materials must conform to the following requirements:
(1) 
Pressure and vacuum control equipment.
When pressure or vacuum control equipment is required on a packaging authorized 
in this section, such equipment must be of a self-reclosing design, must prevent 
package rupture or collapse due to pressure, must prevent significant release of 
lading due to packaging overturn or splashing or surging during normal transport 
conditions, and may be external to the packaging.
(i) Pressure control equipment is not required if pressure in the packaging 
would increase less than 10 percent as a result of heating the lading from the 
lowest design operating temperature to a temperature likely to be encountered if 
the packaging were engulfed in a fire. When pressure control equipment is 
required, it must prevent rupture of the packaging from heating, including fire 
engulfment.

(ii) Vacuum control equipment is not required if the packaging is designed to 
withstand an external pressure of 100 kPa (14.5 psig) or if pressure in the 
packaging would decrease less than 10 percent as a result of the lading cooling 
from the highest design operating temperature to the lowest temperature incurred 
in transport. When vacuum control equipment is required, it must prevent 
collapse of the packaging from a cooling-induced pressure differential.

(iii) When the regulations require a reclosing pressure relief device, the 
lading must not render the devices inoperable (i.e. from clogging, freezing, or 
fouling). If the lading affects the proper operation of the device, the 
packaging must have:
(A) A safety relief device incorporating a frangible disc or a permanent 
opening, each having a maximum effective area of 22 cm
2
(3.4 in.
2
), for transportation by highway;
(B) For transportation of asphalt by highway, a safety relief device 
incorporating a frangible disc or a permanent opening, each having a maximum 
effective area of 48 cm 
2
(7.4 in 
2
); or
(C) For transportation by rail, a non-reclosing pressure relief device 
incorporating a rupture disc conforming to the requirements of § 179.15 of this 
subchapter.

(iv) Reclosing pressure relief devices, rupture discs or permanent openings must 
not allow the release of lading during normal transportation conditions (i.e., 
due to splashing or surging).

(2) 
Closures.
All openings, except permanent vent openings authorized in paragraph (g)(1)(iii) 
of this section, must be securely closed during transportation. Packagings must 
be substantially leak-tight so as not to allow any more than dripping or 
trickling of a non-continuous flow when overturned. Closures must be designed 
and constructed to withstand, without exceeding the yield strength of the 
packaging, twice the static loading produced by the lading in any packaging 
orientation and at all operating temperatures.
(3) 
Strength.
Each packaging must be designed and constructed to withstand, without exceeding 
the yield strength of the packaging, twice the static loading produced by the 
lading in any orientation and at all operating temperatures.
(4) 
Compatibility.
The packaging and lading must be compatible over the entire operating 
temperature range.
(5) 
Markings.
In addition to any other markings required by this subchapter, each packaging 
must be durably marked in a place readily accessible for inspection in 
characters at least 4.8 mm (3/16 inch) with the manufacturer's name, date of 
manufacture, design temperature range, and maximum product weight (or “load 
limit” for tank cars) or volumetric capacity.
(6) 
Accident damage protection.
For transportation by highway, external loading and unloading valves and 
closures must be protected from impact damage resulting from collision or 
overturn. Spraying equipment and the road oil application portion of a packaging 
are excepted from this requirement.
(7) 
New construction.
Specification packagings that are being manufactured for the transport of 
elevated temperature materials must be authorized for current construction.
(h) 
Exceptions
—(1) 
General.
Packagings manufactured for elevated temperature materials service prior to 
October 1, 1993, which are not in full compliance with the requirements in 
paragraph (g) of this section, may continue in service if they meet the 
applicable requirements of subparts A and B of this part and meet the closure 
requirements in paragraph (g)(2) of this section by March 30, 1995.
(2) 
Kettles.
Kettles in service prior to October 1, 1993, which are used to transport asphalt 
or bitumen, are excepted from specific provisions of this section as follows:
(i) Kettles with a total capacity of less than 2650 L (700 gallons), which are 
not in full compliance with the requirements of paragraph (g) of this section, 
may continue in elevated temperature material service if they meet the 
applicable requirements of subparts A and B of this part and if, after March 30,

§ 173.301

General requirements for shipment of compressed gases and other hazardous 
materials in cylinders, UN pressure receptacles and spherical pressure vessels.

(a) 
General qualifications for use of cylinders.
Unless otherwise stated, as used in this section, the term “cylinder” includes a 
UN pressure receptacle. As used in this subpart, filled or charged means an 
introduction or presence of a hazardous material in a cylinder. A cylinder 
filled with a Class 2 hazardous material (gas) and offered for transportation 
must meet the requirements in this section and §§ 173.301a through 173.305, as 
applicable.
(1) Compressed gases must be in UN pressure receptacles built in accordance with 
the UN standards or in metal cylinders and containers built in accordance with 
the DOT and ICC specifications and part 178 of this subchapter in effect at the 
time of manufacture, and requalified and marked as prescribed in subpart C in 
part 180 of this subchapter, if applicable. The DOT and ICC specifications 
authorized for use are as follows:

(2) A cylinder must be filled in accordance with this part. Before each filling 
of a cylinder, the person filling the cylinder must visually inspect the outside 
of the cylinder. A cylinder that has a crack or leak, is bulged, has a defective 
valve or a leaking or defective pressure relief device, or bears evidence of 
physical abuse, fire or heat damage, or detrimental rusting or corrosion, may 
not be filled and offered for transportation. A cylinder may be repaired and 
requalified only as prescribed in subpart C of part 180 of this subchapter.

(3) Pressure relief devices must be tested for leaks before a filled cylinder is 
shipped from the cylinder filling plant. It is expressly forbidden to repair a 
leaking fusible plug device where the leak is through the fusible metal or 
between the fusible metal and the opening in the plug body, except by removal 
and replacement of the pressure relief device.

(4) A cylinder that previously contained a Class 8 material must be requalified 
in accordance with § 180.205(e) of this subchapter.

(5) When a cylinder with a marked pressure limit is prescribed, another cylinder 
made under the same specification but with a higher marked pressure limit is 
authorized. For example, a cylinder marked “DOT-4B500” may be used when 
“DOT-4B300” is specified.

(6) No person may fill a cylinder overdue for periodic requalification with a 
hazardous material and then offer it for transportation. The prohibition against 
offering a cylinder for transportation that is overdue for periodic 
requalification does not apply to a cylinder filled prior to the requalification 
due date.

(7) A cylinder with an authorized service life may not be offered for 
transportation in commerce after its authorized service life has expired. 
However, a cylinder in transportation or a cylinder filled prior to the 
expiration of its authorized service life may 
be transported for reprocessing or disposal of the cylinder's contents. After 
emptying, the cylinder must be condemned in accordance with § 180.205 of this 
subchapter.
(8) The pressure of the hazardous material at 55 °C (131 °F) may not exceed 
5/4
of the service pressure of the cylinder. Sufficient outage must be provided so 
the cylinder will not be liquid full at 55 °C (131 °F).
(9) Specification 2P, 2Q, 3E, 3HT, spherical 4BA, 4D, 4DA, 4DS, and 39 cylinders 
must be packed in strong non-bulk outer packagings. The outside of the 
combination packaging must be marked with an indication that the inner 
packagings conform to the prescribed specifications.

(10) Any person who installs a valve into an aluminum cylinder in oxygen service 
must verify the valve and the cylinder have the same thread type.

(b) 
Cylinder markings.
Required markings on a cylinder must be legible and must meet the applicable 
requirements of subpart C of part 180 of this subchapter. Additional information 
may be marked on the cylinder provided it does not affect the required markings 
prescribed in the applicable cylinder specification.
(c) 
Toxic gases and mixtures.
Cylinders containing toxic gases and toxic gas mixtures meeting the criteria of 
Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A or B must conform to the requirements of § 173.40 and 
CGA S-1.1 (compliance with paragraph 9.1.1.1 is not required) (IBR; see § 171.7 
of this subchapter) and CGA S-7 (IBR; see § 171.7 of this subchapter). A DOT 39 
cylinder, UN non-refillable cylinder, or a UN composite cylinder certified to 
ISO-11119-3 may not be used for a toxic gas or toxic gas mixture meeting the 
criteria for Division 2.3, Hazard Zone A or B.
(d) 
Gases capable of combining chemically.
A filled cylinder may not contain any gas or material capable of combining 
chemically with the cylinder's contents or with the cylinder's material of 
construction, so as to endanger the cylinder's serviceability.
(e) 
Ownership of cylinder.
A cylinder filled with a hazardous material may not be offered for 
transportation unless it was filled by the owner of the cylinder or with the 
owner's consent.
(f) 
Pressure relief device systems.
(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (f)(5) through (f)(7) and (j) of this 
section, and § 171.23(a) of this subchapter, a cylinder filled with a gas and 
offered for transportation must be equipped with one or more pressure relief 
devices sized and selected as to type, location, and quantity, and tested in 
accordance with CGA S-1.1 (compliance with paragraph 9.1.1.1 is not required) 
and CGA Pamphlet S-7 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). The pressure relief 
device must be capable of preventing rupture of the normally filled cylinder 
when subjected to a fire test conducted in accordance with CGA C-14 (IBR, see 
§ 171.7 of this subchapter), or, in the case of an acetylene cylinder, CGA C-12 
(IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).
(2) A pressure relief device, when installed, must be in communication with the 
vapor space of a cylinder containing a Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material.

cubic inches) or less in volume filled with a Liquefied petroleum gas, Methyl 
acetylene and Propadiene mixtures, stabilized, Propylene, Propane or Butane.

(3) For a specification 3, 3A, 3AA, 3AL, 3AX, 3AXX, 3B, 3BN, or 3T cylinder 
filled with gases in other than Division 2.2 (except oxygen and oxidizing gases 
transported by aircraft, see §§ 173.302(f) and 173.304(f)), beginning with the 
first requalification due after December 31, 2003, the burst pressure of a CG-1, 
CG-4, or CG-5 pressure relief device must be at test pressure with a tolerance 
of plus zero to minus 10%. An additional 5% tolerance is allowed when a combined 
rupture disk is placed inside a holder. This requirement does not apply if a 
CG-2, CG-3, or CG-9 thermally activated relief device or a CG-7 reclosing 
pressure valve is used on the cylinder.

(4) A pressure relief device is required on a DOT 39 cylinder regardless of 
cylinder size or filled pressure. A DOT 39 cylinder used for liquefied Division 
2.1 materials must be equipped with a metal pressure relief device. Fusible 
pressure relief devices are not authorized on a DOT 39 cylinder containing a 
liquefied gas.

(5) A pressure relief device is not required on—

(i) A cylinder 305 mm (12 inches) or less in length, exclusive of neck, and 114 
mm (4.5 inches) or less in outside diameter, except when the cylinder is filled 
with a liquefied gas for which this part requires a service pressure of 1800 
psig or higher or a nonliquefied gas to a pressure of 1800 psig or higher at 21 
°C (70 °F);

(ii) A cylinder with a water capacity of less than 454 kg (1000 lbs) filled with

device as required in paragraph (f) of this section, except that pressure relief 
devices on manifolded horizontal cylinders that are mounted on a motor vehicle 
or framework may be selected as to type, location, and quantity according to the 
lowest marked pressure limit of an individual cylinder in the manifolded unit. 
The pressure relief devices selected for the manifolded unit must have been 
tested in accordance with CGA S-1.1 and CGA S-7. Pressure relief devices on 
manifolded horizontal cylinders filled with a compressed gas must be arranged to 
discharge unobstructed to the open air. In addition, for Division 2.1 (flammable 
gas) material, the pressure relief devices (PRDs) must be arranged to discharge 
upward to prevent any escaping gas from contacting personnel or any adjacent 
cylinders. Valves and pressure relief devices on manifolded cylinders filled 
with a compressed gas must be protected from damage by framing, a cabinet or 
other method. Manifolding is authorized for cylinders containing the following 
gases:
(i) Nonliquefied (permanent) compressed gases authorized by § 173.302.

(ii) Liquefied compressed gases authorized by § 173.304. Each manifolded 
cylinder containing a liquefied compressed gas must be separately filled and 
means must be provided to ensure no interchange of cylinder contents can occur 
during transportation.

(iii) Acetylene as authorized by § 173.303. Mobile acetylene trailers must be

500 mL (32 in 
3
). The containers must be packaged in strong, tight outer packagings. The 
pressure in the container may not exceed 145 psia at 54 °C (130 °F). If the 
pressure exceeds 145 psia at 54 °C (130 °F), a DOT 2P container must be used. In 
either case, the metal container must be capable of withstanding, without 
bursting, a pressure of 1.5 times the pressure of the contents at 54 °C (130 
°F). The liquid content of the material and gas may not completely fill the 
container at 54 °C (130 °F). Each container filled for shipment must have been 
heated until its contents reach a minimum temperature of 54 °C (130 °F), without 
evidence of leakage, distortion, or other defect. Each outside shipping 
container must be plainly marked, “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED 
SPECIFICATIONS”.

the weight of water that the container will hold at 16 °C (60 °F). (1 lb of 
water = 27.737 in 
3
at 60 °F.).

Note 2:
Cylinders purchased after Oct. 1, 1944, for the transportation of chlorine must 
contain no aperture other than that provided in the neck of the cylinder for 
attachment of a valve equipped with an approved pressure relief device. 
Cylinders purchased after Nov. 1, 1935, and filled with chlorine may not contain 
over 68.04 kg (150 lb) of gas.

Note 3:
[Reserved]

Note 4:
Special carbon dioxide mining devices containing a heating element and filled 
with not over 2.72 kg (6 lb) of carbon dioxide may be filled to a density of not 
over 85 percent, provided the cylinder is made of steel with a calculated 
bursting pressure in excess of 39000 psig, fitted with a frangible disc that 
will operate at not over 57 percent of that pressure, and is able to withstand a 
drop of 10 feet when striking crosswise on a steel rail while under a pressure 
of at least 3000 psig. Such devices must be shipped in strong boxes or must be 
wrapped in heavy burlap and bound by 12-gauge wire with the wire completely 
covered by friction tape. Wrapping must be applied so as not to interfere with 
the functioning of the frangible disc pressure relief device. Shipments must be 
described as “liquefied carbon dioxide gas (mining device)” and marked, labeled, 
and certified as prescribed for liquefied carbon dioxide.

Note 5:
All parts of valve and pressure relief devices in contact with contents of 
cylinders must be of a metal or other material, suitably treated if necessary, 
that will not cause formation of any acetylides.

Note 6:
[Reserved]

Note 7:
Specification 3HT cylinders for aircraft use only, having a maximum service life 
of 24 years. Authorized only for nonflammable gases. Cylinders must be equipped 
with pressure relief devices of the frangible disc type that meet the 
requirements of § 173.301(f). Each frangible disc must have a rated bursting 
pressure that does not exceed 90 percent of the minimum required test pressure 
of the cylinder. Discs with fusible metal backing are not permitted. Cylinders 
may be offered for transportation only when packaged in accordance with 
§ 173.301(a)(9).

Note 8:

See

Note 11:
Must meet the valve and cleaning requirements in § 173.302(b).

Note 12:
For an insecticide gas that is nontoxic and nonflammable, 
see
§ 173.305(c).

Note 13:
For a refrigerant or dispersant gas that is nontoxic and nonflammable, 
see
§ 173.304(d).


Note 14:
The use of DOT specification cylinder with a marked service pressure of 480 psi 
is authorized until December 31, 2003.
(b) [Reserved]

(c) 
Verification of content in cylinder.
Except as noted in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the amount of liquefied gas 
filled into a cylinder must be by weight or, when the gas is lower in pressure 
than required for liquefaction, a pressure-temperature chart for the specific 
gas may be used to ensure that the service pressure at 55 °C (131 °F) will not 
exceed 
5/4
of the service pressure at 21 °C (70 °F). The weight of liquefied gas filled 
into the cylinder also must be checked, after disconnecting the cylinder from 
the filling line, by the use of an accurate scale.
(d) Requirements for liquefied petroleum gas. (1) Filling density limits are as 
follows:

(2) Subject to § 173.301a(d), any filling density percentage prescribed in this 
section is authorized to be increased by a factor of 2 for liquefied petroleum 
gas in DOT 3 cylinders or in DOT 3A cylinders marked for 1800 psig, or higher, 
service pressure.

(3) Liquefied petroleum gas must be shipped in specification cylinders as 
follows:

(i) DOT 3, 3A, 3AA, 3B, 3E, 3AL, 4B, 4BA, 4B240ET, 4BW, 4E, or 39 cylinders. 
Shipments of flammable gases in DOT 3AL cylinders are authorized only when 
transported by motor vehicle, rail car, or cargo-only aircraft.

(ii) Additional containers may be used within the limits of quantity and 
pressure as follows:



Type of container

Maximum capacity (cubic inches)

Maximum filling pressure
(psig)


DOT-2P or DOT-2Q (see Note 1)

DOT-2P or DOT-2Q (see Note 1)

31.83

35 psig at 70 °F and 100 psig at 130 °F.


Note 1:
Containers must be packed in strong wooden or fiber boxes of such design as to 
protect valves from damage or accidental functioning under conditions normally 
incident to transportation. Each completed container filled for shipment must 
have been heated until its contents reach a temperature of 54 °C (130 °F), 
without evidence of leakage, distortion, or other defect. Each outside shipping 
container must be plainly marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH PRESCRIBED 
SPECIFICATIONS'.

Note 2:
A container must be equipped with a pressure relief device that will prevent 
rupture of the container and dangerous projection of a closing device when 
exposed to fire.
(4) 
Verification of content.
A cylinder with a water capacity of 90.72 kg (200 lb) or more and for use with a 
liquefied petroleum gas with a specific gravity of 0.504 or greater at 16 °C (60 
°F) may have the quantity of its contents determined by using a fixed length dip 
tube gauging device. The length of the dip 
tube must be such that when a liquefied petroleum gas, with a specific volume of 
0.03051 cu. ft./lb. at a temperature of 40 °F, is filled into the container, the 
liquid just reaches the bottom of the tube. The weight of this liquid may not 
exceed 42 percent of the water capacity of the container, which must be stamped 
on the cylinder. The length of the dip tube, expressed in inches carried out to 
one decimal place and prefixed with the letters “DT”, must be stamped on the 
container and on the exterior of removable type dip tube. For the purpose of 
this requirement, the marked length must be expressed as the distance measured 
along the axis of a straight tube from the top of the boss through which the 
tube is inserted to the proper level of the liquid in the container. The length 
of each dip tube must be checked when installed by weighing each container after 
filling except when installed in groups of substantially identical containers, 
in which case one of each 25 containers must be weighed. The quantity of 
liquefied gas in each container must be checked by means of the dip tube after 
disconnecting from the filling line. The outlet from the dip tube may not be 
larger than 0.1016 centimeters (0.040 inch; No. 54 drill bit size orifice). A 
container representative of each day's filling at each filling plant must have 
its contents checked by weighing after disconnecting from the filling line.
(e) 
Carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid.
(1) The following provisions apply to carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid, and 
nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid:
(i) DOT 4L cylinders conforming to the provisions of this paragraph are 
authorized.

(ii) Each cylinder must be protected with at least one pressure relief device 
and at least one frangible disc conforming to § 173.301(f) and paragraph (a)(2) 
of this section. The relieving capacity of the pressure relief device system 
must be equal to or greater than that calculated by the applicable formula in 
paragraph 5.8.3 of CGA S-1.1 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(iii) The temperature and pressure of the gas at the time the shipment is 
offered for transportation may not exceed −18 °C (0 °F) and 290 psig for carbon 
dioxide and −15.6 °C ( + 4 °F) and 290 psig for nitrous oxide. Maximum time in 
transit may not exceed 120 hours.

§ 173.304b

Additional requirements for shipment of liquefied compressed gases in UN 
pressure receptacles.

(a) 
General.
Liquefied gases and gas mixtures must be offered for transportation in UN 
pressure receptacles subject to the requirements in this section and § 173.304. 
In addition, the general requirements applicable to UN pressure receptacles in 
§§ 173.301 and 173.301b must be met.
(b) 
UN pressure receptacle filling limits.
A UN pressure receptacle is authorized 
for the transportation of liquefied compressed gases and gas mixtures as 
specified in this section. When a liquefied compressed gas or gas mixture is 
transported in a UN pressure receptacle, the filling ratio may not exceed the 
maximum filling ratio prescribed in this section and the applicable ISO 
standard. Compliance with the filling limits may be determined by referencing 
the numerical values and data in Table 2 of P200 of the UN Recommendations (IBR, 
see § 171.7 of this subchapter). Alternatively, the maximum allowable filling 
limits may be determined as follows:
(1) For high pressure liquefied gases, in no case may the filling ratio of the 
settled pressure at 65 °C (149 °F) exceed the test pressure of the UN pressure 
receptacle.

(2) For low pressure liquefied gases, the filling factor (maximum mass of 
contents per liter of water capacity) must be less than or equal to 95 percent 
of the liquid phase at 50 °C. In addition, the UN pressure receptacle may not be 
liquid full at 60 °C. The test pressure of the pressure receptacle must be equal 
to or greater than the vapor pressure of the liquid at 65 °C.

(3) For high pressure liquefied gases or gas mixtures, the maximum filling ratio 
may be determined using the formulas in (3)(b) of P200 of the UN 
Recommendations.

(4) For low pressure liquefied gases or gas mixtures, the maximum filling ratio 
may be determined using the formulas in (3)(c) of P200 of the UN 
Recommendations.

(c) Tetraflouroethylene, stabilized, UN1081 must be packaged in a pressure 
receptacle with a minimum test pressure of 200 bar and a working pressure not 
exceeding 5 bar.

(d) Fertilizer ammoniating solution with free ammonia, UN1043 is not authorized 
in UN tubes or MEGCs.

§ 173.305

Charging of cylinders with a mixture of compressed gas and other material.

(a) 
Detailed requirements.
A mixture of a compressed gas and any other material must be shipped as a 
compressed gas if the mixture is a compressed gas as designated in § 173.115 and 
when not in violation of § 173.301(a).
(b) 
Filling limits.
(See § 173.301.) For mixtures, the liquid portion of the liquefied compressed 
gas at 131 °F. plus any additional liquid or solid must not completely fill the 
container.
(c) 
Nonpoisonous and nonflammable mixtures.
Mixtures containing compressed gas or gases including insecticides, which 
mixtures are nonpoisonous and nonflammable under this part must be shipped in 
cylinders as prescribed in § 173.304(a) or as follows:
(1) Specification 2P (§ 178.33 of this subchapter). Inside metal containers 
equipped with safety relief devices of a type examined by the Bureau of 
Explosives and approved by the Associate Administrator, and packed in strong 
wooden or fiber boxes of such design as to protect valves from damage or 
accidental functioning under conditions incident to transportation. Pressure in 
the container may not exceed 85 psia at 70 °F. Each completed metal container 
filled for shipment must be heated until content reaches a minimum temperature 
of 130 °F., without evidence of leakage, distortion or other defect. Each 
outside shipping container must be plainly marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH 
PRESCRIBED SPECIFICATIONS.”

(2) [Reserved]

(d) 
Poisonous mixtures.
A mixture containing any poisonous material (Division 6.1 or 2.3) in such 
proportions that the mixture would be classed as poisonous under § 173.115 or 
§ 173.132 must be shipped in packagings as authorized for these poisonous 
materials.

§ 173.306

Limited quantities of compressed gases.

(a) Limited quantities of compressed gases for which exceptions are permitted as 
noted by reference to this section in § 172.101 of this subchapter are excepted 
from labeling, except when offered for transportation or transported by air, 
and, unless required 
as a condition of the exception, specification packaging requirements of this 
subchapter when packaged in accordance with the following paragraphs. For 
transportation by aircraft, the package must conform to the applicable 
requirements of § 173.27 and only packages of hazardous materials authorized 
aboard passenger-carrying aircraft may be transported as a limited quantity. In 
addition, shipments are not subject to subpart F (Placarding) of part 172 of 
this subchapter, to part 174 of this subchapter except § 174.24, and to part 177 
of this subchapter except § 177.817. Except as otherwise provided in this 
section, each package may not exceed 30 kg (66 lbs.) gross weight.
(1) When in containers of not more than 4 fluid ounces capacity (7.22 cubic 
inches or less) except cigarette lighters. Additional exceptions for certain 
compressed gases in limited quantities and the ORM-D hazard class are provided 
in paragraph (i) of this section.

(2) When in refillable metal containers filled with a material that is not 
classed as a hazardous material to not more than 90% of capacity at 21.1 °C (70 
°F) and then charged with nonflammable, nonliquefied gas. Each container must be 
tested to three times the pressure at 21.1 °C (70 °F) and, when refilled, be 
retested to three times the pressure of the gas at 21.1 °C (70 °F). Also, one of 
the following conditions must be met:

(i) The container is not over 0.95 L (1 quart) capacity and charged to not more 
than 170 psig (1172.1 kPa) at 21.1 °C (70 °F), and must be packed in a strong 
outer packaging; or

(ii) The container is not over 114 L (30 gallons) capacity and charged to not 
more than 75 psig (517.1 kPa) at 21.1 °C (70 °F).

(3) When in a metal aerosol container (see § 171.8 of this subchapter for the 
definition of 
aerosol
). Authorized containers include non-specification, DOT 2P (§ 178.33 of this 
subchapter), DOT 2Q (§ 178.33a of this subchapter), or DOT 2Q1 (§ 178.33(d) of 
this subchapter) design, provided the following conditions are met. Additional 
exceptions for aerosol containers conforming to this paragraph (a)(3) are 
provided in paragraph (i) of this section.
(i) 
Capacity.
The capacity of the container must not exceed 1 L (61.0 cubic inches).
(ii) 
General pressure conditions.
The authorized metal aerosol containers and associated pressure limitations are 
provided in the following table. Pressure inside the container may not exceed 
180 psig at 54.4 °C (130 °F) except as may be authorized by variations of a DOT 
specification container type. In any event, the metal container must be capable 
of withstanding without bursting a pressure of at least one and one-half times 
the equilibrium pressure of the contents at 54.4 °C (130 °F).

container at 54.4 °C (130 °F).
(iv) 
Outer packaging.
The containers must be packed in strong outer packagings.
(v) 
Pressure testing.
Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, each container, after it is 
filled, must be subjected to a test performed in a hot water bath; the 
temperature of the bath and the duration of the test must be such that the 
internal pressure reaches that which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F), or 50 
°C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the 
container at 50 °C (122 °F)). If the contents are sensitive to heat, the 
temperature of the bath must be set at between 20 °C (68 °F) and 30 °C (86 °F) 
but, in addition, one container in 2,000 must be tested at the higher 
temperature. No leakage or permanent deformation of a container may occur. 
However, instead of this standard water bath test, container(s) may be tested 
using one of the following methods subject to certain conditions—

(A) 
Alternative water bath test.
(
1
) One filled container in a lot of 2,000 must be subjected to a test performed 
in a hot water bath; the temperature of the bath and the duration of the test 
must be such that the internal pressure reaches that which would be reached at 
55 °C (131 °F). If the container shows evidence of leakage or permanent 
deformation, the lot of 2,000 containers must be rejected;
(
2
) A second filled container in the lot of 2,000 must be weighed and compared to 
the weight specification for the containers as documented in the operating 
procedures for the weight test. Failure of the container to meet the weight 
specification is evidence of leakage or overfilling and the lot of 2,000 must be 
rejected;
(
3
) The remainder of the containers in the lot of 2,000 must be visually inspected 
(e.g, examination of the seams). Containers showing evidence of leakage or 
overfilling must not be transported; and
(
4
) Each person employing this test must maintain a copy of the operating 
procedures (or an electronic file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, 
its principal place of business and must make the procedures available upon 
request, at a reasonable time and location, to an authorized official of the 
Department.
(B) 
Automated pressure test.
Each person employing an automated process for pressure testing of filled 
containers must develop procedures for implementation of the test. Each person 
must maintain a copy of the procedures (or an electronic file thereof) that is 
accessible at, or through, its principal place of business and must make the 
procedures available upon request, at a reasonable time and location, to an 
authorized official of the Department. The procedures must, at a minimum, 
include instruction on the following:
(
1
) Pressure specifications. Each person must specify pressure standard(s) (e.g., 
a pressure limit or range) for a container respective of the design and/or 
contents. Each container, after it is filled, must be pressure checked and 
compared to the standards. For a pressure limit, any container exceeding the 
pressure limit must be rejected. For a pressure range, any container outside of 
the set range must be rejected. The instruments used to determine the pressure 
must be properly calibrated before a production run to an accuracy of ±or 
better; and
(
2
) Periodic inspection. At designated intervals, a randomly selected container 
must be inspected for proper closure and verification of filling pressure. If a 
container shows signs of improper closure or over-filling, five (5) additional 
randomly selected containers must be inspected. If any of the additional 
containers show signs of improper closure or over-filling, all containers 
produced since the last inspection must be rejected.
(C) 
Weight test.
Each person employing a weight test of filled containers must develop procedures 
for implementation of the test. Each person must maintain a copy of the 
procedures (or an electronic file thereof) that is accessible at, or through, 
its principal place of business and must make the procedures available upon 
request, at a reasonable time and location, to an authorized official of the 
Department. The procedures must, at a minimum, include instruction on the 
following:
(
1
) Weight specifications. Each person must specify target weight specifications 
for a particular container. Each container, after it is filled, must be weighed 
and compared to the target weight specification for the container. Any container 
outside the target weight specification is an indication of leakage or 
overfilling and must be rejected. The instruments used to determine the weight 
must be properly calibrated before a testing run and be sufficiently sensitive 
to measure within 0.10 g of the true weight of the container;
(
2
) Heat testing and pressure limits. One container out of each lot of 
successfully filled containers must be heat tested by raising the internal 
pressure until it reaches that which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F). The lot 
size should be no greater than 2,000. If the pressure in the container exceeds 
the maximum pressure allowed for the container type or if the container shows 
signs of leakage or permanent deformation, the lot must be rejected. 
Alternatively, five (5) additional randomly selected containers from the lot may 
be tested to qualify the lot but if any 
of the five containers fail the test, the entire lot must be rejected;
(
3
) Periodic inspection. At intervals of not more than 10 minutes, a randomly 
selected container must be inspected for proper closure and verification of 
filling pressure. If a container shows signs of improper closure or 
over-filling, five (5) additional randomly selected containers must be 
inspected. If any of the additional containers show signs of improper closure or 
over-filling, all containers produced since the last inspection must be 
rejected; and
(
4
) Visual inspection. Each container must be visually inspected prior to being 
packed. Any container showing signs of leakage or permanent deformation must be 
rejected.
(D) 
Leakage test.
(
1
) Pressure and leak testing before filling. Each empty container must be 
subjected to a pressure equal to or in excess of the maximum expected in the 
filled containers at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does 
not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). This must be 
at least two-thirds of the design pressure of the container. If any container 
shows evidence of leakage at a rate equal to or greater than 3.3 × 10
−2
mbar L/s at the test pressure, distortion or other defect, it must be rejected; 
and
(
2
) Testing after filling. The person filling each container must ensure that the 
crimping equipment is set appropriately and the specified propellant is used 
before filling a container. Once filled, each container must be weighed and leak 
tested. The leak detection equipment must be sufficiently sensitive to detect at 
least a leak rate of 2.0 × 10
−3
mbar L/s at 20 °C (68 °F). Any filled container which shows evidence of leakage, 
deformation, or overfilling must be rejected.
(vi) Each outer packaging must be marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH 
PRESCRIBED REGULATIONS.”

(4) Gas samples must be transported under the following conditions:

(i) A gas sample may only be transported as non-pressurized gas when its 
pressure corresponding to ambient atmospheric pressure in the container is not 
more than 105 kPa absolute (15.22 psia).

(ii) Non-pressurized gases, toxic (or toxic and flammable) must be packed in 
hermetically sealed glass or metal inner packagings of not more than one L (0.3 
gallons) overpacked in a strong outer packaging.

(iii) Non-pressurized gases, flammable must be packed in hermetically sealed 
glass or metal inner packagings of not more than 5 L (1.3 gallons) and 
overpacked in a strong outer packaging.

(5) For limited quantities of Division 2.2 gases with no subsidiary risk, when 
in a non-DOT specification or a specification DOT 2S (§ 178.33b of this 
subchapter) plastic aerosol container (see § 171.8 of this subchapter for the 
definition of aerosol) provided all of the following conditions are met. 
Additional exceptions for aerosols conforming to this paragraph (a)(5) are 
provided in paragraph (i) of this section.

(i) 
Capacity.
The capacity of the container must not exceed 1 L (61.0 cubic inches).
(ii) 
General pressure conditions.
Authorized plastic aerosol containers and associated pressure limitations are 
provided in the following table. The pressure in the container must not exceed 
160 psig at 54.4 °C (130 °F). The container must be capable of withstanding 
without bursting a pressure of at least one and one-half times the equilibrium 
pressure of the contents at 54.4 °C (130 °F).

(iii) 
Liquid fill.
Liquid content of the material and gas must not completely fill the container at 
54.4 °C (130 °F).
(iv) 
Outer packaging.
The containers must be packed in strong outer packagings.
(v) 
Pressure testing.
Except as provided in paragraph (a)(5)(vi) of this section, each container must 
be subjected to a test performed in a hot water bath. The temperature of the 
bath and 
the duration of the test must be such that the internal pressure reaches that 
which would be reached at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase 
does not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). If the 
contents are sensitive to heat, or if the container is made of plastic material 
which softens at this test temperature, the temperature of the bath must be set 
at between 20 °C (68 °F) and 30 °C (86 °F) but, in addition, one container in 
2,000 must be tested at the higher temperature. No leakage or permanent 
deformation of a container is permitted except that a plastic container may be 
deformed through softening provided that it does not leak.
(vi) 
Leakage test.
As an alternative to the hot water bath test in paragraph (a)(5)(v) of this 
section, testing may be performed as follows:
(A) Pressure and leak testing before filling. Each empty container must be 
subjected to a pressure equal to or in excess of the maximum expected in the 
filled containers at 55 °C (131 °F) or 50 °C (122 °F) if the liquid phase does 
not exceed 95% of the capacity of the container at 50 °C (122 °F). This must be 
at least two-thirds of the design pressure of the container. If any container 
shows evidence of leakage at a rate equal to or greater than 3.3 × 10
−2
mbar L/s at the test pressure, distortion or other defect, it must be rejected; 
and
(B) Testing after filling. Prior to filling, the filler must ensure that the 
crimping equipment is set appropriately and the specified propellant is used 
before filling the container. Once filled, each container must be weighed and 
leak tested. The leak detection equipment must be sufficiently sensitive to 
detect at least a leak rate of 2.0 × 10
−3
mbar L/s at 20 °C (68 °F). Any filled container that shows evidence of leakage, 
deformation, or excessive weight must be rejected.
(vii) Each outer packaging must be marked “INSIDE CONTAINERS COMPLY WITH 
PRESCRIBED REGULATIONS.”

(b) 
Exceptions for foodstuffs, soap, biologicals, electronic tubes, and audible fire 
alarm systems.
Limited quantities of compressed gases (except Division 2.3 gases) for which 
exceptions are provided as indicated by reference to this section in § 172.101 
of this subchapter, when in conformance with one of the following paragraphs, 
are excepted from labeling, except when offered for transportation or 
transported by aircraft, and the specification packaging requirements of this 
subchapter. For transportation by aircraft, the package must conform to the 
applicable requirements of § 173.27 and only packages of hazardous materials 
authorized aboard passenger-carrying aircraft may be transported as a limited 
quantity. In addition, shipments are not subject to subpart F (Placarding) of

Each sample lighter must be examined for conformance with paragraph (a) of this 
section by a person authorized by the Associate Administrator. In addition, 
lighters must be subjected to the following leakage test:
(i) A minimum of six lighters must be examined and tested at one time. Store the 
lighters in a desiccator for 24 hours. After drying, weigh each lighter on an 
analytical balance capable of accurately measuring to within 
1/10
of a milligram (0.0001 grams).
(ii) After weighing, place the lighters together in an explosion-proof, 
controlled-temperature laboratory oven capable of maintaining 38 ±1 °C (100 ±2 
°F) for 96 continuous hours (4 days). At the end of 96 hours, remove the 
lighters from the oven and place them in the same desiccator and allow the 
lighters to cool to ambient temperature.

(iii) After cooling, weigh each lighter and determine the net weight differences 
for each lighter tested (subtract the mass after oven exposure from the original 
mass before oven exposure).

(iv) Weight losses must be assessed to determine the quantity of gas that leaked 
from the lighters and from the weight change as a result of absorbed moisture. 
If the net weight has increased, the test facility must run the required test 
using six empty lighters in parallel with the six filled lighters. The parallel 
tests are conducted to determine the weight of moisture absorbed in the plastic 
in order to determine the weight loss of the lighters from gas leakage.

(v) If the net weight loss for any one of the six lighters exceeds 20 milligrams 
(0.020 grams), the design must be rejected.

(vi) Lighters manufactured to a rejected lighter design may not be offered for 
transportation or transported in commerce unless approved in writing by the 
Associate Administrator.

(4) 
Recordkeeping requirements.
(i) Following the examination of each new lighter design, the person or agency 
that conducted the examination and test must prepare a test report and make that 
test report available to the manufacturer. At a minimum, the test report must 
contain the following information:
(A) Name and address of test facility;

(B) Name and address of applicant;

(C) A test report identifier, that is, the authorized person or agency 
identifier code immediately followed by an alpha/numeric identifier of four or 
more characters assigned to the specific lighter design by the authorized person 
or agency (e.g., “LAA****,” where, “LAA” is the identification code assigned to 
the authorized person or agency by the Associate Administrator and “****” is 
replaced with the unique test report identifier assigned to the specific lighter 
design by the authorized person or agency);

(D) Manufacturer of the lighter. For a foreign manufacturer, the U.S. agent or 
importer must be identified;

(E) Description of the lighter design type (e.g., model, dimensions, ignition 
mechanism, reservoir capacity, lot/batch number) in sufficient detail to ensure 
conformance with paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section; and

(F) A certification by the authorized testing agency that the lighter design 
conforms to paragraph (a) of this section and passes or does not pass the 
required leakage test in paragraph (b) of this section.

(ii) For as long as any lighter design is in production and for at least three 
years thereafter, a copy of each lighter's test report must be maintained by the 
authorized testing agency that performed the examination and testing and the 
manufacturer of the design. For a foreign manufacturer, each test report must be 
maintained in accordance with this paragraph by the foreign manufacturer's U.S. 
agent or importer.

(iii) Test reports must be traceable to a specific lighter design and must be 
made available to a representative of the Department upon request.

(5) 
Transitional provisions.
Until January 1, 2012, approval numbers issued by the Associate Administrator 
prior to January 1, 2007 may continue to be marked on packages and annotated on 
shipping papers, where applicable. After that time, previously issued approvals 
(
i.e.,
T-***) will no longer be valid and each lighter design currently in production 
must be re-examined and tested under the provisions of this section.
(c) 
Packaging requirements
—(1) 
Inner containment.
Lighters must be placed in an inner packaging that is designed to prevent 
movement of the lighters and inadvertent ignition or leakage. The ignition 
device and gas control lever of each lighter must be designed, or securely 
sealed, taped, or otherwise fastened or packaged to protect against accidental 
functioning or leakage of the contents during transport. If lighters are packed 
vertically in a plastic tray, a plastic, fiberboard or paperboard partition must 
be used to prevent friction between the ignition device and the inner packaging.
(2) 
Outer packaging.
Lighters and their inner packagings must be tightly packed and secured against 
movement in any rigid specification outer packaging authorized in subpart L of 
part 178 of this subchapter at the Packing Group II performance level.
(d) 
Shipping paper and marking requirements.
(1) In addition to the requirements of subpart C of part 172, shipping papers 
must be annotated with the lighter design test report identifier (see paragraph 
(b)(4)(i)(C) of this section) traceable to the test report assigned to the 
lighters or, if applicable, the previously issued approval number (
i.e.,
T***), in association with the basic description.
(2) In addition to the requirements of subpart D of part 172, a lighter design 
test report identifier (see paragraph (b)(4)(i)(C) of this section) or, if 
applicable, the previously issued approval number (
i.e.,
T***), must be marked on a package containing lighters.
(3) For transportation by vessel in a closed transport vehicle or a closed 
freight container, the following warning must be affixed to the access doors:

WARNING—MAY CONTAIN EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES WITH AIR—KEEP IGNITION SOURCES AWAY WHEN 
OPENING

The warning must be on a contrasting background and must be in letters measuring 
at least 12.7 mm (0.5 inch) in height.

(e) 
Exceptions
—(1) 
Common or contract carriage.
For highway transportation by common or contract carrier, when no more than 
1,500 lighters covered by this section are transported in one motor vehicle, the 
requirements of subparts C through H of part 172, and part 177 of this 
subchapter do not apply. 
Lighters transported in accordance with this paragraph are also excepted from 
the specification packaging, shipping paper, and marking requirements specified 
in § 173.308(c) and (d). Inner packagings must conform to paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section. Lighters must be further packaged in rigid, strong outer 
packagings meeting the general packaging requirements of subpart B of part 173. 
Outer packagings must be plainly and durably marked, on two opposing sides or

§ 173.312

Requirements for shipment of MEGCs.

(a) 
General requirements.
(1) Unless otherwise specified, a MEGC is authorized for the shipment of 
liquefied and non-liquefied compressed gases. Each pressure receptacle contained 
in a MEGC must meet the requirements in §§ 173.301, 173.301b, 173.302b and 
173.304b, as applicable.
(2) The MEGC must conform to the design, construction, inspection and 
testing requirements prescribed in § 178.75 of this subchapter.
(3) No person may offer or accept a hazardous material for transportation in a 
MEGC that is damaged to such an extent that the integrity of the pressure 
receptacles or the MEGC's structural or service equipment may be affected.

(4) No person may fill or offer for transportation a pressure receptacle in a 
MEGC if the pressure receptacle or the MEGC is due for periodic requalification, 
as prescribed in subpart C to part 180 of this subchapter. However, this 
restriction does not preclude transportation of pressure receptacles filled and 
offered for transportation prior to the requalification due date.

(5) Prior to filling and offering a MEGC for transportation, the MEGC's 
structural and service equipment must be visually inspected. Any unsafe 
condition must be corrected before the MEGC is offered for transportation. All 
required markings must be legible.

(6) Except for Division 2.2 permanent gases, each pressure receptacle must be 
equipped with an individual shutoff valve that must be tightly closed while in 
transit. For Division 2.1, Division 2.2 liquefied gases and 2.3 gases, the 
manifold must be designed so that each pressure receptacle can be filled 
separately and be kept isolated by a valve capable of being closed during 
transit. For Division 2.1 gases, the pressure receptacles must be isolated by a 
valve into assemblies of not more than 3,000 L.

(b) 
Filling.
(1) A MEGC may not be filled to a pressure greater than the lowest marked 
working pressure of any pressure receptacle. A MEGC may not be filled above its 
marked maximum permissible gross mass.
(2) After each filling, the shipper must verify the leakproofness of the 
closures and equipment. Each fill opening must be closed by a cap or plug.

(c) 
Damage protection.
During transportation, a MEGC must be protected against damage to the pressure 
receptacles and service equipment resulting from lateral and longitudinal impact 
and overturning as prescribed in § 178.75 of this subchapter.

§ 173.314

Compressed gases in tank cars and multi-unit tank cars.

(a) 
Definitions.
For definitions of compressed gases, see § 173.115.
(b) 
General requirements.
(1) Tank car tanks containing compressed gases 
must not be shipped unless they were loaded by or with the consent of the owner 
thereof.
(2) Tank car tanks must not contain gases capable of combining chemically and 
must not be loaded with any gas which combines chemically with the gas 
previously loaded therein, until all residue has been removed and interior of 
tank thoroughly cleaned.

(3) For tanks of the DOT-106A and 110A class, the tanks must be placed in 
position and attached to car structure by the shipper.

(4) Wherever the word “approved” is used in this part of the regulations, it 
means approval by the Association of American Railroads Committee on Tank Cars 
as prescribed in § 179.3 of this subchapter.

(5) Each tank car used for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia or any 
material that meets the criteria of Division 2.1 or 2.3 must have gaskets for 
manway cover plates and for mounting of fittings designed (for temperature, 
application, media, pressure, and size) to create a positive seal so that, under 
conditions normally incident to transportation, there will not be an 
identifiable release of the material to the environment. The use of sealants to 
install gaskets is prohibited.

(c) 
Authorized gases, filling limits for tank cars.
A compressed gas in a tank car or a multi-unit tank car must be offered for 
transportation in accordance with § 173.31 and this section. The gases listed 
below must be loaded and offered for transportation in accordance with the 
following table:

Notes:
1. The percent filling density for liquefied gases is hereby defined as the 
percent ratio of the mass of gas in the tank to the mass of water that the tank 
will hold. For determining the water capacity of the tank in kilograms, the mass 
of 1 L of water at 15.5 °C in air is 1 kg. (the mass of one gallon of water at 
60 °F in air is 8.32828 pounds).
2. The liquefied gas must be loaded so that the outage is at least two percent 
of the total capacity of the tank at the reference temperature of 46 °C (115 °F) 
for a noninsulated tank; 43 °C (110 °F) for a tank having a thermal protection 
system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance 
at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour per square meter 
per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature 
differential; and 41 °C (105 °F) for an insulated tank having an insulation 
system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall thermal conductance 
at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules per hour per square meter 
per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature 
differential.

3. The requirements of § 173.24b(a) apply.

4. The gas pressure at 54.44 °C (130 °F.) in any non-insulated tank car may not 
exceed 
7/10
of the marked test pressure, except that a tank may be charged with helium to a 
pressure 10 percent in excess of the marked maximum gas pressure at 54.44 °C 
(130 °F.) of each tank.
5. The liquid portion of the gas at −17.77 °C (0 °F.) must not completely fill 
the tank.

6. The maximum permitted filling density is 125 percent. The quantity of 
chlorine loaded into a single unit-tank car may not be loaded in excess of the 
normal lading weights nor in excess of 81.65 Mg (90 tons).

7. 89 percent maximum to 80.1 percent minimum at a test pressure of 6.2 Bar (90 
psig).

8. 59.6 percent maximum to 53.6 percent minimum at a test pressure of 7.2 Bar 
(105 psig).

9. For a liquefied petroleum gas, the liquefied gas must be loaded so that the 
outage is at least one percent of the total capacity of the tank at the 
reference temperature of 46 °C (115 °F) for a noninsulated tank; 43 °C (110 °F) 
for a tank having a thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that 
provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 10.22 
kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per 
square foot/per degree F) temperature differential; and 41 °C (105 °F) for an 
insulated tank having an insulation system incorporating a metal jacket that 
provides an overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 
1.5333 kilojoules per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per 
hour/per square foot/per degree F) temperature differential.

10. For liquefied petroleum gas and anhydrous ammonia, during the months of 
November through March (winter), the following reference temperatures may be 
used: 38 °C (100 °F) for a noninsulated tank; 32 °C (90 °F) for a tank having a 
thermal protection system incorporating a metal jacket that provides an overall 
thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 10.22 kilojoules per hour 
per square meter per degree Celsius (0.5 Btu per hour/per square foot/per degree 
F) temperature differential; and 29 °C (85 °F) for an insulated tank having an 
insulation system incorporating a metal jacket and insulation that provides an 
overall thermal conductance at 15.5 °C (60 °F) of no more than 1.5333 kilojoules 
per hour per square meter per degree Celsius (0.075 Btu per hour/per square 
foot/per degree F) temperature differential. The winter reference temperatures 
may only be used for a tank car shipped directly to a consumer for unloading and 
not stored in transit. The offeror of the tank must inform each customer that 
the tank car was filled based on winter reference temperatures. The tank must be 
unloaded as soon as possible after March in order to retain the specified outage 
and to prevent a release of hazardous material which might occur due to the tank 
car becoming liquid full at higher temperatures.

11. For materials poisonous by inhalation, the single unit tank car tanks 
authorized are only those cars approved by the Tank Car Committee for 
transportation of the specified material and built prior to March 16, 2009.

12. Except as provided by paragraph (d) of this section, for materials poisonous 
by inhalation, fusion-welded tank car tanks built on or after March 16, 2009 
used for the transportation of the PIH materials noted, must meet the applicable 
authorized tank car specification and must be equipped with a head shield as 
prescribed in § 179.16(c)(1).

(d) 
Alternative tank car tanks for materials poisonous by inhalation.
(1) As an alternative to the authorized tank car specification noted in the 
column 4 of the table in paragraph (c) of this section, a car of the same 
authorized tank car specification but of the next lower test pressure, as 
prescribed in column 5 of the table at § 179.101-1, may be used provided both of 
the following conditions are met:
(i) The difference between the alternative and the required minimum plate 
thicknesses, based on the calculation prescribed in § 179.100-6 of this 
subchapter, is added to the alternative tank car jacket and head shield. When 
the jacket and head shield are made from any authorized steel with a minimum 
tensile strength from 70,000 p.s.i. to 80,000 p.s.i., but the required minimum 
plate thickness calculation is based on steel with a minimum tensile strength of 
81,000 p.s.i., the thickness to be added to the jacket and head shield must be 
increased by a factor of 1.157. Forming allowances for heads are not required to 
be considered when calculating thickness differences as prescribed in this 
paragraph.

(ii) The tank car jacket and head shield must be manufactured from carbon steel 
plate as prescribed in § 179.100-7(a) of this subchapter.

(e) 
Verification of content.
(1) The amount of liquefied gas loaded into each tank may be determined either 
by measurement or calculation of the weight, except that DOT specification tank 
car tanks authorized for the transportation of anhydrous ammonia and ammonia 
solution may have the 
amount of liquefied gas loaded into the tank car measured by a metering device 
in conformance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section.
(2) 
Metering device.
(i) Tank cars loaded with anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution through the use 
of a metering device in conformance with this section are not required to be 
weighed, but must have their outage measured with a magnetic gauging device to 
determine that the tank car is properly loaded in conformance with this 
paragraph. Written procedures for loading a tank car using a metering device 
must be developed and made available at each location where such loading takes 
place. Certification in writing of the inspection and completion of these 
loading and/or unloading procedures must be maintained for each tank car and 
maintained in accordance with the recordkeeping requirements in paragraph 
(e)(2)(iii) of this section, and all necessary records must be completed. At a 
minimum, these procedures will specify:
(A) The tank car must be offered for transportation in conformance with all 
applicable government regulations.

(B) Any defects found when the tank car is examined before shipping must be 
recorded, and the tank must not be loaded until the repairs to eliminate each 
defect are completed.

(C) The tank car must be allowed to sit undisturbed for at least 10 minutes 
after loading to allow material within the tank to settle. After this has 
occurred a final check for leaks must be conducted prior to offering the tank 
car for transportation.

(ii) One out of every 10 tank cars loaded by the use of the metering device must 
be gauged utilizing the fixed gauging equipment on the tank car to verify by 
calculation the amount of anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution contained in the 
tank car.

(iii) 
Recordkeeping.
The following information must be maintained and be made available to any 
representative of the DOT upon request for each tank car loaded with the use of 
a metering device:
(A) Date loaded,

(B) Date shipped,

(C) Tank car reporting marks,

(D) DOT Specification,

(E) Tank car stenciled shell capacity (gallons/liters),

(F) Tank car stenciled tare weight (pounds/kilograms),

(G) Outage or innage table number,

(H) Water capacity of tank in pounds and/or kilograms,

(I) Maximum permitted filling density (see § 173.314),

(J) Specific gravity of anhydrous ammonia or ammonia solution at the reference 
temperature,

(K) Tank car outage (inches/meters, gallons/liters),

(L) Gallons/liters of liquid ammonia in tank car,

(M) Quantity of vapor ammonia in tank car (gallons/liters), and

(N) Total calculated ammonia (liquid & vapor) in tank car (pounds/kilograms).

(f) [Reserved]

(g) Special requirements for hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, and vinyl 
fluoride,stabilized.

(1) The shipper shall notify the Federal Railroad Administration whenever a tank 
car is not received by the consignee within 20 days from the date of shipment. 
Notification to the Federal Railroad Administration may be made by e-mail to 
Hmassist@fra.dot.gov
or telephone call to (202) 493-6229.
(2) A tank car containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid must have the 
auxiliary valve on the pressure relief device closed during transportation.

(3) See § 179.102-17 of this subchapter for additional requirements.

(4) Tank cars containing hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid, must be 
unloaded to such an extent that any residue remaining in the tank at a reference 
temperature of 32 °C (90 °F) will not actuate the reclosing pressure relief 
device.

(h) 
Special requirements for liquefied petroleum gas
—(1) 
Odorization.
All liquefied petroleum gas must be odorized as required in this paragraph to 
indicate positively, by a distinctive odor, the presence of gas down to a 
concentration in air of not over one-fifth the lower limit of combustibility; 
however, odorization is not required if it is harmful in the use or further 
processing of the liquefied petroleum gas or if it will serve no useful purpose 
as a 
warning agent in such use or further processing.
(i) The lower limits of combustibility of the more commonly used liquefied 
petroleum gases are: Propane, 2.15 percent; butane, 1.55 percent. These figures 
represent volumetric percentages of gas-air mixtures in each case.

(ii) The use of 1.0 pound of ethyl mercaptan per 10,000 gallons of liquefied 
petroleum gas is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this 
paragraph. Use of another odorant is not prohibited so long as there is enough 
to meet the requirements of this paragraph (h).

(2) 
Odorant fade.
In addition to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section, the offeror must ensure that 
enough odorant will remain in the tank car during the course of transportation. 
The shipper must have procedures in place to:
(i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of 
odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas;

(ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually 
injected, the required amount of odorant is added;

(iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically 
injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required 
amount of odorant is consistently added;

(iv) Ensure quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons who 
receive tank cars that have been subjected to any condition that could lead to 
corrosion of the tank car or receive new or recently cleaned tank cars are 
notified of this information and that a person filling these packagings 
implement quality control measures so that potential odorant fade is addressed;

(v) Inspect a tank car for signs of oxidation or corrosion; and

(vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorization remains in the 
tank car during the course of transportation, such as increasing the amount of 
odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas.

(i) [Reserved]

(j) 
Special requirements for materials having a primary or secondary Division 2.1

liquid discharge valves. Tank cars constructed to a DOT 105A500W specification 
may be marked as a DOT 105A300W specification with the size and type of 
reclosing pressure relief valves required by the marked specification.
(2) DOT105J500W tank cars may be used as authorized packagings, as prescribed in 
this subchapter for transporting “UN 1017, Chlorine, 2.3 (8), Poison Inhalation 
Hazard, Zone B, RQ,” if the tank cars meet all DOT specification requirements, 
and the tank cars are equipped with combination safety relief valves with a 
start-to-discharge pressure of 360 psi, rather than the 356 psi. The 
start-to-discharge pressure setting must be marked on the pressure relief device 
in conformance with applicable provisions of the AAR Specification for Tank Cars 
(IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(l) 
Special requirements for hydrogen sulphide.
Each multi-unit tank car must be equipped with adequate pressure relief devices 
of the fusible plug type having a yield temperature not over 76.66 °C (170 °F.), 
and not less than 69.44 °C (157 °F.). Each device must be resistant to extrusion

Note 1:
Filling is permitted by volume provided the same filling density is used as 
permitted by weight, except when using fixed length dip tube or other fixed 
maximum liquid level indicators (paragraph (f) of this section), in which case 
the maximum permitted filling density shall not exceed 97 percent of the maximum 
permitted filling density by weight contained in the table.
(1) 
Odorization.
All liquefied petroleum gas must be odorized as required in this paragraph to 
indicate positively, by a distinctive odor, the presence of gas down to a 
concentration in air of not over one-fifth the lower limit of combustibility; 
however, odorization is not required if it is harmful in the use or further 
processing of the liquefied petroleum gas or if it will serve no useful purpose 
as a warning agent in such use or further processing.
(i) The lower limits of combustibility of the more commonly used liquefied 
petroleum gases are: Propane, 2.15 percent; butane, 1.55 percent. These figures 
represent volumetric percentages of gas-air mixtures in each case.

(ii) The use of 1.0 pound of ethyl mercaptan per 10,000 gallons of liquefied 
petroleum gas is considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this 
paragraph (b). Use of any other odorant is not prohibited so long as there is 
enough to meet the requirements of this paragraph.

(2) 
Odorant fade.
For cargo tanks or portable tanks being transported from a refinery, gas plant 
or pipeline terminal and in addition to paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, the 
offeror must ensure that enough odorant will remain in the cargo tank or 
portable tank during the course of transportation. The shipper must have 
procedures in place to:
(i) Ensure quantitative testing methods are used to measure the amount of 
odorant in the liquefied petroleum gas;

(ii) Ensure that, when the odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is manually 
injected, the required amount of odorant is being added;

(iii) Ensure that, when odorization of liquefied petroleum gas is automatically 
injected, equipment calibration checks are conducted to ensure the required 
amount of odorant is consistently added;

(iv) Ensure that quality control measures are in place to make sure that persons 
who receive cargo tanks or portable tanks that have been subjected to any 
condition that could lead to corrosion of the packaging or receive new or 
recently cleaned cargo tanks or portable tanks are notified of this information 
and that a person filling these packagings implement quality control measures to 
ensure that potential odorant fade is addressed;

(v) Inspect a cargo tank or portable tank for signs of oxidation or corrosion; 
and

(vi) Take corrective action needed to ensure enough odorant remains in the cargo 
tank or portable tank during the course of transportation, such as increasing 
the amount of odorant added to the liquefied petroleum gas.

(c) Except as otherwise provided, the loading of a liquefied gas into a cargo 
tank or portable tank shall be determined by weight or by a suitable liquid 
level gauging device. The vapor pressure (psig) at 115 °F. must not exceed the 
design pressure of the cargo tank or portable tank container. The outage and 
filling limits for liquefied gases must be as prescribed in § 173.24b of this 
part, except that this requirement does not apply to:

(1) 
A tank containing carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, 
refrigerated liquid.
Such tank is required to be equipped with suitable pressure control valves and 
may not be filled to a level exceeding 95 percent of the volumetric capacity of 
the tank.
(2) 
A tank containing ethane, refrigerated liquid; ethane-propane mixture, 
refrigerated liquid; or hydrogen chloride, refrigerated liquid.
Such tank must be filled to allow at least two percent outage below the inlet of 
the pressure relief valve or pressure control valve under conditions of 
incipient opening, with the tank in a level attitude.
(d) If the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied 
gases is to be determined by weight, the gross weight shall be checked after the 
filling line is disconnected in each instance. The gross weight shall be 
calculated from the tank capacity and tare weight set forth on the metal plate 
required by the specification, and the maximum filling density permitted for the 
material being loaded into the tank as set forth in the table, paragraph (a) of 
this section.

(e) If the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied 
gases is to be determined by adjustable liquid level device, each tank and each 
compartment thereof shall have a thermometer well, so that the internal liquid 
temperature can easily be determined, and the amount of liquid in the tank shall 
be corrected to a 60 °F. basis. Liquid levels shall not exceed a level 
corresponding to the maximum filling density permitted for the material being 
loaded into the tank as set forth in the table in paragraph (a) of this section.

(f) When the loading of cargo tanks and portable tank containers with liquefied 
gases is determined only by fixed length dip tube or other fixed maximum liquid 
level indicator, the device shall be arranged to function at a level not to 
exceed the maximum permitted volume prescribed by the table, paragraph (a) of 
this section. Loading shall be stopped when the device functions.

(g) Containers, the liquid level of which has been determined by means of a 
fixed length dip tube gauging device, shall not be acceptable for stowage as 
cargo on vessels in commerce subject to the jurisdiction of the United States 
Coast Guard. Nothing contained in this section shall be so construed as to 
prohibit the transportation on car floats or car ferries of motor vehicles laden 
with containers nor cargo tanks the liquid level of either of which has been 
determined by means of fixed length dip tube devices.

(h) Each cargo tank and portable tank, except a tank filled by weight, must be 
equipped with one or more of the gauging devices described in the following 
table which indicate accurately the maximum permitted liquid level. Additional 
gauging devices may be installed but may not be used as primary controls for 
filling of cargo tanks and portable tanks. Gauge glasses are 
not permitted on any cargo tank or portable tank. Primary gauging devices used 
on cargo tanks of less than 3500 gallons water capacity are exempt from the 
longitudinal location requirements specified in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of 
this section provided: The tank length does not exceed three times the tank 
diameter; and the cargo tank is unloaded within 24 hours after each filling of 
the tank.

(1) The design pressure of the liquid level gauging devices shall be at least 
equal to the design pressure of the tank.

(2) If the primary gauging device is adjustable, it must be capable of 
adjustment so that the end of the tube will be in the location specified in 
paragraph (h)(3) of this section for at least one of the ladings to be 
transported, at the filling level corresponding to an average loading 
temperature. Exterior means must be provided to indicate this adjustment. The 
gauging device must be legibly and permanently marked in increments not 
exceeding 20 Fahrenheit degrees (or not exceeding 25 p.s.i.g. on tanks for 
carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid), to 
indicate the maximum levels to which the tank may be filled with liquid at 
temperatures above 20 °F. However, if it is not practicable to so mark the 
gauging device, this information must be legibly and permanently marked on a 
plate affixed to the tank adjacent to the gauging device.

(3) A dip tube gauging device consists of a pipe or tube with a valve at its 
outer end with its intake limited by an orifice not larger than 0.060 inch in 
diameter. If a fixed length dip tube is used, the intake must be located midway 
of the tank both longitudinally and laterally and at maximum permitted filling 
level. In tanks for liquefied petroleum gases, the intake must be located at the 
level reached by the lading when the tank is loaded to maximum filling density 
at 40 °F.

(4) Except on a tank used exclusively for the transportation of carbon dioxide, 
refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, refrigerated liquid, each opening for a 
pressure gauge must be restricted at or inside the tank by an orifice no larger 
than 0.060 inch in diameter. For carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous 
oxide, refrigerated liquid service, the pressure gauge need only be used during 
the filling operation.

(i) Each tank must be provided with one or more pressure relief devices which, 
unless otherwise specified in this part, must be of the spring-loaded type. Each 
valve must be arranged to discharge upward and unobstructed to the outside of 
the protective housing to prevent any impingement of escaping gas upon the tank. 
For each chlorine tank the protective housing must be in compliance with the 
requirements set forth in the applicable specification.

(1) The safety relief valves on each tank must meet the following conditions:

(i) The total relieving capacity, as determined by the flow formulas contained 
in Section 5 of CGA S-1.2 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), must be 
sufficient to prevent a maximum pressure in the tank of more than 120 percent of 
the design pressure;
(ii) The flow capacity rating, testing and marking must be in accordance with 
Sections 5, 6 and 7 of CGA Pamphlet S-1.2.

(iii) For an insulated tank, the required relieving capacity of the relief 
devices must be the same as for an uninsulated tank, unless the insulation will 
remain in place and will be effective under fire conditions. In this case, 
except for UN portable tanks, each insulated tank must be covered by a sheet 
metal jacket of not less than 16 gauge thickness. For UN portable tanks where 
the relieving capacity of the valves has been reduced on the basis of the 
insulation system, the insulation system must remain effective at all 
temperatures less than 649 °C (1200.2 °F) and be jacketed with a material having 
a melting point of 700 °C (1292.0 °F) or greater.

(iv) An MC 330 cargo tank that has relief valves sized by Fetterly's formula 
dated November 27, 1928, may be continued in service.

(2) Each safety relief valve must be arranged to minimize the possibility of 
tampering. If the pressure setting or adjustment is external to the valve, the 
safety relief valve must be provided with means for sealing the adjustment and 
it must be sealed.

(3) Each safety relief valve on a portable tank, other than a UN portable tank, 
must be set to start-to-discharge at pressure no higher than 110% of the tank 
design pressure and no lower than the design pressure specified in paragraph (a) 
of this section for the gas transported. For UN portable tanks used for 
liquefied compressed gases and constructed in accordance with the requirements 
of § 178.276 of this subchapter, the pressure relief device(s) must conform to 
§ 178.276(e) of this subchapter.

(4) Except for UN portable tanks, each safety relief valve must be plainly and 
permanently marked with the pressure in p.s.i.g. at which it is set to 
discharge, with the actual rate of discharge of the device in cubic feet per 
minute of the gas or of air at 60 °F (15.6 °C) and 14.7 p.s.i.a., and with the 
manufacturer's name or trade name and catalog number. The start-to-discharge 
valve marking must be visible after the valve is installed. The rated discharge 
capacity of the device must be determined at a pressure of 120% of the design 
pressure of the tank. For UN portable tanks, each pressure relief device must be 
clearly and permanently marked as specified in § 178.274(f)(1) of this 
subchapter.

(5) Each safety relief valve must have direct communication with the vapor space 
in the tank.

(6) Each connection to a safety relief valve must be of sufficient size to 
provide the required rate of discharge through the safety relief valve.

(7) [Reserved]

(8) Each pressure relief valve outlet must be provided with a protective device 
to prevent the entrance and accumulation of dirt and water. This device must not 
impede flow through the valve. Pressure relief devices must be designed to 
prevent the entry of foreign matter, the leakage of liquid and the development 
of any dangerous excess pressure.

(9) On tanks for carbon dioxide, refrigerated liquid or nitrous oxide, 
refrigerated liquid each safety relief device must be installed and located so 
that the cooling effect of the contents will not prevent the effective operation 
of the device. In addition to the required safety relief valves, these tanks may 
be equipped with one or more pressure controlling devices.

For tanks in helium and atmospheric gas (except oxygen) cryogenic liquid 
service, the pressure relief system must have a flow capacity equal to or 
greater than that calculated by the applicable formula in paragraphs 5.3.2 or 
5.3.3 of CGA Pamphlet S-1.2. If the pressure relief system consists of a 
combination of pressure relief valves and frangible discs, the pressure relief 
valves must have a total venting capacity equal to or greater than that 
calculated by the applicable formula in paragraph 4.1.10.1.1 of CGA Pamphlet 
S-1.2. The pressure relief system must have this total flow capacity at a 
pressure not exceeding 150 percent of the tank's design pressure. The flow 
capacity and rating must be verified and marked by the manufacturer of the 
device in accordance with CGA Pamphlet S-1.2.

(3)

liquid (except carbon monoxide) service may be equipped with one or both of the 
following:
(i) One or more pressure control valves set at a pressure below the tank's 
design pressure.

(ii) One or more frangible discs set to function at a pressure not less than one 
and one-half times or more than two times the tank's design pressure.

(6) 
Maximum filling rate.
(i) For a tank used in oxygen and flammable cryogenic liquid service, the 
maximum rate at which the tank is filled must not exceed the liquid flow 
capacity of the primary pressure relief system rated at a pressure not exceeding 
120 percent of the tank's design pressure.
(ii) On a tank used in helium and atmospheric gas (except oxygen) cryogenic 
liquid service, the maximum rate at which the tank is filled must not exceed the 
liquid flow capacity of the pressure relief valves rated at 150 percent of the 
tank's design pressure.

(7) 
Arrangement and location of pressure relief devices.
(i) The discharge from any pressure relief system must be directed upward and be 
unobstructed to the outside of the protective housing in such a manner as to 
prevent impingement of gas upon the jacket or any structural part of the 
vehicle.
(ii) Each pressure relief valve must be arranged or protected to prevent the 
accumulation of foreign material between the relief valve and the atmospheric 
discharge opening in any relief piping. The arrangement must not impede flow 
through the device.

(iii) Each pressure relief valve must be designed and located to minimize the 
possibility of tampering. If the pressure setting or adjustment is external to 
the valve, the valve adjustment must be sealed.

(iv) Each pressure relief device must have direct communication with the vapor 
space of the tank at the midlength of the top centerline.

(v) Each pressure relief device must be installed and located so that the 
cooling effect of the contents during venting will not prevent the effective 
operation of the device.

(vi) All pressure relief device inlets must under maximum filling conditions be 
situated in the vapor space of the closed cryogenic receptacle and the devices 
must be arranged to ensure that the escaping vapor is discharged unobstructed.

(8) 
Connections.
(i) Each connection to a pressure relief device must be of sufficient size to 
allow the required rate of discharge through the pressure relief device. The 
inlet connection must be not less than one-half inch nominal pipe size.
(ii) A shut-off valve may be installed in a pressure relief system only when the 
required relief capacity is provided at all times.

(9) 
Pressure relief devices for piping hose and vacuum-insulated jackets.
(i) Each portion of connected liquid piping or hose that can be closed at both 
ends 
must be provided with either a hydrostatic pressure relief valve without an 
intervening shut-off valve, or a check valve permitting flow from the pipe or 
hose into the tank. If used, the relief valve must be located so as to prevent 
its discharge from impinging on the tank, piping, or operating personnel.
(ii) On a vacuum-insulated cargo tank the jacket must be protected by a suitable 
relief device to release internal pressure. The discharge area of this device 
must be at least 0.00024 square inch per pound of water capacity of the tank. 
This relief device must function at a pressure not exceeding the internal design 
pressure of the jacket, calculated in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME 
Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter), or 25 psig, whichever is less.

(10) 
Tank inlet, outlet, pressure relief device and pressure control valve markings.
(i) Each tank inlet and outlet, except pressure relief devices and pressure 
control valves, must be permanently marked to indicate whether it communicates 
with “vapor” or “liquid” when the tank is filled to the maximum permitted 
filling density.
(ii) Each pressure relief valve must be plainly and permanently marked with the 
pressure, in psig, at which it is set-to-discharge, the discharge rate of the 
device in SCF per minute (SCFM) of free air, and the manufacturer's name or 
trade name and catalog number. The marked set-to-discharge pressure valve must 
be visible with the valve in its installed position. The rated discharge 
capacity of the device must be determined at a pressure of 120 percent of the 
design pressure of the tank.

(iii) Each pressure control valve must be plainly and permanently marked with 
the pressure, in psig, at which it is set-to-discharge.

(c) 
Weight of lading requirements.
The weight of a cryogenic liquid in the tank must be determined by weighing or 
by the use of a liquid level gauging device authorized in § 178.338-14(a) of 
this subchapter, and may not exceed the lesser of:
(1) The weight of lading in the tank, based on the water capacity stamped on the 
nameplate (§ 178.338-18(a)(4) of this subchapter) and the appropriate maximum 
permitted filling density specified in paragraph (f) of this section; or

(2) The maximum weight of lading for which the cargo tank was designed, as 
marked on the specification plate (see § 178.338-18(b) of this subchapter).

(d) 
Outage.
Except for a cargo tank containing helium, cryogenic liquid, a cargo tank 
offered for transportation must have an outage of at least two percent below the 
inlet of the pressure relief device or pressure control valve, under conditions 
of incipient opening, with the tank in a level attitude.
(e) 
Temperature.
A flammable cryogenic liquid in a cargo tank at the start of travel must be at a 
temperature sufficiently cold that the pressure setting of the pressure control 
valve or the required pressure relief valve, whichever is lower, will not be 
reached in less time than the marked rated holding time for the cryogenic liquid 
(see paragraph (g)(3) of this section and § 178.338-9(b) of this subchapter).
(f) 
Specification MC-338 (§ 178.338 of this subchapter) cargo tanks
are authorized for the shipment of the following cryogenic liquids subject to 
the following additional requirements:
(1) For purposes of this section, “filling density” is defined as the percent 
ratio of the weight of lading in the tank to the weight of water that the tank 
will hold at the design service temperature (one pound of water = 27.737 cubic 
inches at 60 °F., or one gallon of water = 231 cubic inches at 60 °F. and weighs 
8.32828 pounds).

Mixtures of cryogenic liquid.
Where charging requirements are not specifically prescribed in this paragraph 
(f), the cryogenic liquid must be shipped in packagings and under conditions 
approved by the Associate Administrator.
(g) 
One-way travel time; marking.
The jacket of a cargo tank to be used to transport a flammable cryogenic liquid 
must be marked on its right side near the front, in letters and numbers at least 
two inches high, “One-Way-Travel-Time __ hrs.”, with the blank filled in with a 
number indicating the one-way travel time (OWTT), in hours, of 
the cargo tank for the flammable cryogenic liquid to be transported. A cargo 
tank that is partially unloaded at one or more locations must have additional 
marking “One-Way-Travel-Time __ hrs. __ psig to __ psig at __ percent filling 
density,” with the second blank filled in with the pressure existing after 
partial unloading and the third blank filled in with the set-to-discharge 
pressure of the control valve or pressure relief valve, and the fourth blank 
with the filling density following partial unloading. Multiple OWTT markings for 
different pressure levels are permitted. The abbreviation “OWTT” may be used in 
place of the words “One-way-travel-time” in the marking required by this 
paragraph.
(1) OWTT is based on the marked rated holding time (MRHT) of the cargo tank for 
the cryogenic liquid to be transported in the cargo tank. If the MRHT for the 
flammable cryogenic liquid is not displayed on or adjacent to the specification 
plate, this MRHT may be derived.

(2) The MRHT is converted to OWTT, in hours, as follows:

(i) For a tank with an MRHT of 72 hours or less, 

OWTT = (MRHT − 24) / 2

(ii) For a tank with an MRHT greater than 72 hours, 

OWTT = MRHT − 48

(3) Each cargo tank motor vehicle used to transport a flammable cryogenic liquid 
must be examined after each shipment to determine its actual holding time. The 
record required by § 177.840(h) of this subchapter may be used for this 
determination. If the examination indicates that the actual holding time of the 
cargo tank, after adjustment to reflect an average ambient temperature of 85 °F, 
is less than 90 percent of the marked rated holding time (MRHT) for the 
cryogenic liquid marked on the specification plate or adjacent thereto (see 
§ 178.338-18(b) of this subchapter), the tank may not be refilled with any 
flammable cryogenic liquid until it is restored to its marked rated holding time 
value or it is re-marked with the actual marked rated holding time determined by 
this examination. If the name of the flammable cryogenic liquid that was 
transported and its marked rated holding time is not displayed on or adjacent to 
the specification plate, this requirement may be met by deriving the MRHT of the 
cargo tank for that flammable cryogenic liquid and comparing that derived MRHT 
with the actual holding time after adjustment.

(e) 
Special requirements for class DOT 113 tank cars
—(1) A class DOT-113 tank car need not be periodically pressure tested; however, 
each shipment must be monitored to determine the average daily pressure rise in 
the tank car. If the average daily pressure rise during any shipment exceeds 0.2 
Bar (3 psig) per day, the tank must be tested for thermal integrity prior to any 
subsequent shipment.
(2) 
Thermal integrity test.
When required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, either of the following 
thermal integrity tests may be used:
(i) 
Pressure rise test.
The pressure rise in the tank may not exceed 0.34 Bar (5 psig) in 24 hours. When 
the pressure rise test is performed, the absolute pressure in the annular space 
of the loaded tank car may not exceed 75 microns of mercury at the beginning of 
the test and may not increase more than 25 microns during the 24-hour period; or
(ii) 
Calculated heat transfer rate test.
The insulation system must be performance tested as prescribed in § 179.400-4 of 
this subchapter. When the calculated heat transfer rate test is performed, the 
absolute pressure in the annular space of the loaded tank car may not exceed 75 
microns of mercury at the beginning of the test and may not increase more than 
25 microns during the 24-hour period. The calculated heat transfer rate in 24 
hours may not exceed:
(A) 120 percent of the appropriate standard heat transfer rate specified in 
§ 179.401-1 of this subchapter, for DOT-113A60W and DOT-113C120W tank cars;

(B) 122.808 joules (0.1164 Btu/day/lb.) of inner tank car water capacity, for 
DOT-113A175W tank cars;

(C) 345.215 joules (0.3272 Btu/day/lb.) of inner tank car water capacity, for 
DOT-113C60W and 113D60W tank cars; or

§ 173.412

Additional design requirements for Type A packages.

In addition to meeting the general design requirements prescribed in § 173.410, 
each Type A packaging must be designed so that—

(a) The outside of the packaging incorporates a feature, such as a seal, that is 
not readily breakable, and that, while intact, is evidence that the package has 
not been opened. In the case of packages shipped in closed transport vehicles in 
exclusive use, the cargo compartment, instead of the individual packages, may be 
sealed.

(b) The smallest external dimension of the package is not less than 10 cm (4 
inches).

(c) Containment and shielding is maintained during transportation and storage in 
a temperature range of −40 °C (−40 °F) to 70 °C (158 °F). Special attention 
shall be given to liquid contents and to the potential degradation of the 
packaging materials within the temperature range.

(d) The packaging must include a containment system securely closed by a 
positive fastening device that cannot be opened unintentionally or by pressure 
that may arise within the package during normal transport. Special form Class 7 
(radioactive) material, as demonstrated in accordance with § 173.469, may be 
considered as a component of the containment system. If the containment system 
forms a separate unit of the package, it must be securely closed by a positive 
fastening device that is independent of any other part of the package.

(e) For each component of the containment system account is taken, 
where applicable, of radiolytic decomposition of materials and the generation of 
gas by chemical reaction and radiolysis.
(f) The containment system will retain its radioactive contents under the 
reduction of ambient pressure to 60 kPa (8.7 psia).

(g) Each valve, other than a pressure relief device, is provided with an 
enclosure to retain any leakage.

(h) Any radiation shield that encloses a component of the packaging specified as 
part of the containment system will prevent the unintentional escape of that 
component from the shield.

(i) Failure of any tie-down attachment that is a structural part of the 
packaging, under both normal and accident conditions, must not impair the 
ability of the package to meet other requirements of this subpart.

(j) When evaluated against the performance requirements of this section and the 
tests specified in § 173.465 or using any of the methods authorized by 
§ 173.461(a), the packaging will prevent—

(1) Loss or dispersal of the radioactive contents; and

(2) A significant increase in the radiation levels recorded or calculated at the 
external surfaces for the condition before the test.

(k) Each packaging designed for liquids will—

(1) Be designed to provide for ullage to accommodate variations in temperature 
of the contents, dynamic effects and filling dynamics;

(2) Meet the conditions prescribed in paragraph (j) of this section when 
subjected to the tests specified in § 173.466 or evaluated against these tests 
by any of the methods authorized by § 173.461(a); and

(3) Either—

(i) Have sufficient suitable absorbent material to absorb twice the volume of 
the liquid contents. The absorbent material must be compatible with the package 
contents and suitably positioned to contact the liquid in the event of leakage; 
or

(ii) Have a containment system composed of primary inner and secondary outer 
containment components designed to enclose the liquid contents completely and 
ensure retention of the liquid within the secondary outer component in the event 
that the primary inner component leaks.

(l) Each package designed for gases, other than tritium not exceeding 40 TBq 
(1080Ci) or noble gases not exceeding the A
2
value appropriate for the noble gas, will be able to prevent loss or dispersal 
of contents when the package is subjected to the tests prescribed in § 173.466 
or evaluated against these tests by any of the methods authorized by 
§ 173.461(a).

certificate under § 173.471, § 173.472 or § 173.473.

[Amdt. 173-244, 60 FR 50307, Sept. 28, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 3677, Jan. 26, 
2004]


§ 173.433

Requirements for determining basic radionuclide values, and for the listing of 
radionuclides on shipping papers and labels.

(a) For individual radionuclides listed in the table in § 173.435 and § 173.436:

(1) A
1
and A
2
values are given in the table in § 173.435; and
(2) Activity concentration exemption values and consignment activity exemption 
values are given in the table in § 173.436.

(b) For individual radionuclides which are not listed in the tables in § 173.435 
or § 173.436 or for which no relevant data are available:

(1) the radionuclide values in Tables 7 or 8 of this section may be used; or

(2) other basic radionuclide values may be used provided they are first approved 
by the Associate Administrator or, for international transport, multilateral 
approval is obtained from the pertinent Competent Authorities.

(c) In calculating A1 and A
2
values for approval in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section:
(1) It is permissible to use an A
2
value calculated using a dose coefficient for the appropriate lung absorption 
type, as recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, 
if the chemical forms of each radionuclide under both normal and accident 
conditions of transport are taken into consideration.
(2) A single radioactive decay chain in which the radionuclides are present in 
their naturally-occurring proportions, and in which no daughter nuclide has a 
half life either longer than 10 days or longer than that of the parent nuclide, 
will be considered as a single radionuclide, and the activity to be taken into 
account and the A
1
or A
2
value to be applied will be those corresponding to the parent nuclide of that 
chain. Otherwise, the parent and daughter nuclides will be considered as a 
mixture of different nuclides.
(d) Mixtures of radionuclides whose identities and respective activities are 
known must conform to the following conditions:

(1) For special form Class 7 (radioactive) material, the activity which may be 
transported in a Type A package must satisfy:


ER26JA04.001


Where:

B(i) is the activity of radionuclide i in special form; and

A
1
(i) is the A
1
value for radionuclide i.
(2) For normal form Class 7 (radioactive) material, the activity which may be 
transported in a Type A package must satisfy:



ER26JA04.002


Where:

C(j) is the activity of radionuclide j in normal form; and

A
2
(j) is the A
2
value for radionuclide j.
(3) If the package contains both special and normal form Class 7 (radioactive) 
material, the activity which may be transported in a Type A package must 
satisfy:


ER11JY14.096


Where:

The symbols are defined as in paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section.

(4) Alternatively, the A
1
value for a mixture of special form material may be determined as follows:

ER26JA04.004


Where:

f(i) is the fraction of activity for radionuclide i in the mixture; and

A
1
(i) is the appropriate A
1
value for radionuclide i.
(5) Alternatively, the A
2
value for mixtures of normal form material may be determined as follows:

ER26JA04.005


Where:

f(i) is the fraction of activity for normal form radionuclide i in the mixture; 
and

A
2
(i) is the appropriate A
2
value for radionuclide i.
(6) The exempt activity concentration for mixtures of nuclides may be determined 
as follows:


ER13se04.013


Where:

f(i) is the fraction of activity concentration of nuclide i in the mixture; and 
[A](i) is the activity concentration for exempt material containing nuclide i.

(7) The activity limit for an exempt consignment for mixtures of nuclides may be 
determined as follows:


ER26JA04.007


Where:

f(i) is the fraction of activity of nuclide i in the mixture; and

A(i) is the activity limit for exempt consignments for nuclide i.

(e) When the identity of each nuclide is known but the individual activities of 
some of the radionuclides are not known, the radionuclides may be grouped and 
the lowest A
1
or A
2
value, as appropriate, for the radionuclides in each group may be used in 
applying the formulas in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(5) of this section. 
Groups may be based on the total alpha activity and the total beta/gamma 
activity when these are known, using the lowest A
1
or A
2
values for the alpha emitters or beta/gamma emitters, respectively.

(f) When the identity of each nuclide is known but the individual activities of 
some of the radionuclides are not known, the radionuclides may be grouped and 
the lowest [A] (activity concentration for exempt material) or A (activity limit 
for exempt consignment) value, as appropriate, for the radionuclides in each 
group may be used in applying the formulas in paragraphs (d)(6) and (d)(7) of 
this section. Groups may be based on the total alpha activity and the total 
beta/gamma activity when these are known, using the lowest [A] or A values for 
the alpha emitters or beta/gamma emitters, respectively.

(g) 
Shipping papers and labeling.
For mixtures of radionuclides, the radionuclides (n) that must be shown on 
shipping papers and labels in accordance with §§ 172.203 and 172.403 of this 
subchapter, respectively, must be determined on the basis of the following 
formula:

ER26JA04.008


Where:

n + m represents all the radionuclides in the mixture;

m are the radionuclides that do not need to be considered;

a
(i)
is the activity of radionuclide i in the mixture; and
A
(i)
is the A
1
or A
2
value, as appropriate for radionuclide i.

§ 173.441

Radiation level limitations and exclusive use provisions.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each package of Class 7 
(radioactive) materials offered for transportation must be designed and prepared 
for shipment, so that under conditions normally incident to transportation, the 
radiation level does not exceed 2 mSv/hour (200 mrem/hour) at any point on the 
external surface of the package, and the transport index does not exceed 10.

(b) A package which exceeds the radiation level limits specified in paragraph 
(a) of this section must be transported by exclusive use shipment, and the 
radiation levels for such shipment may not exceed the following during 
transportation:

(1) 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) on the external surface of the package unless the 
following conditions are met, in which case the limit is 10 mSv/h (1000 mrem/h):

(i) The shipment is made in a closed transport vehicle;

(ii) The package is secured within the vehicle so that its position remains 
fixed during transportation; and

(iii) There are no loading or unloading operations between the beginning and end 
of the transportation;

(2) 2 mSv/h (200 mrem/h) at any point on the outer surfaces of the vehicle, 
including the top and underside of the vehicle; or in the case of a flat-bed 
style vehicle, at any point on the vertical planes projected from the outer 
edges of the vehicle, on the upper surface of the load or enclosure if used, and 
on the lower external surface of the vehicle;

(3) 0.1 mSv/h (10 mrem/h) at any point 2 m (6.6 feet) from the outer lateral 
surfaces of the vehicle (excluding the top and underside of the vehicle); or in 
the case of a flat-bed style vehicle, at any point 2 m (6.6 feet) from the 
vertical planes projected by the outer edges of the vehicle (excluding the top 
and underside of the vehicle); and

(4) 0.02 mSv/h (2mrem/h) in any normally occupied space, except that this 
provision does not apply to carriers if they operate under the provisions of a 
State or federally regulated radiation protection program and if personnel under 
their control who are in such an occupied space wear radiation dosimetry 
devices.

(c) For shipments made under the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
the offeror shall provide specific written instructions for maintenance of the 
exclusive use shipment controls to the carrier. The instructions must be 
included with the shipping paper information. The instructions must be 
sufficient so that, when followed, they will cause the carrier to avoid actions 
that will unnecessarily delay delivery or unnecessarily result in increased 
radiation levels or radiation exposures to transport workers or members of the 
general public.

(d) Conveyance limits on the sum of package transport indices are as follows:

(1) Except for shipments by cargo aircraft only or by seagoing vessel, the sum 
of transport indices for a non-exclusive use shipment may not exceed 50.

(2) Where a consignment is transported under exclusive use, there is no limit on 
the sum of the transport indices aboard a single conveyance. The conditions of 
paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4) and (c) must be met.

(3) Provisions for shipments of Class 7 (radioactive) materials by air are 
described in §§ 175.700-175.705 of this subchapter.

(4) Provisions for shipment of Class 7 (radioactive) materials by vessel are 
described in §§ 176.700-176.720 of this subchapter.

(e) A package exceeding the maximum surface radiation level or maximum transport 
index prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section may not be transported by 
aircraft.

during conditions normally incident to transport, affect the integrity of the 
package; and

(b) The temperature of the accessible external surfaces of the loaded package 
will not, assuming still air in the shade at an ambient temperature of 38 °C 
(100 °F), exceed either—

(1) 50 °C (122 °F) in other than an exclusive use shipment; or

(2) 85 °C (185 °F) in an exclusive use shipment.


§ 173.443

Contamination control.

(a) The level of non-fixed contamination must be kept as low as reasonably 
achievable on the external surfaces of each package, conveyance, freight 
container, and overpack offered for transport, and the internal surfaces of each 
conveyance, freight container, and overpack in which inner packages or 
receptacles of Class 7 (radioactive) materials are offered for transport.

(1) Excluding the interior surfaces of the containment system of packages and 
the internal surfaces of a conveyance, freight container, tank, or intermediate 
bulk container dedicated to the transport of unpackaged radioactive material in 
accordance with § 173.427(c) and remaining under that specific exclusive use, 
the level of non-fixed contamination may not exceed the limits set forth in 
Table 9 and must be determined by either:

(i) Wiping an area of 300 cm
2
of the surface concerned with an absorbent material, using moderate pressure, 
and measuring the activity on the wiping material. Sufficient measurements must 
be taken in the most appropriate locations to yield a representative assessment 
of the non-fixed contamination levels. The amount of radioactivity measured on 
any single wiping material, divided by the surface area wiped and divided by the 
efficiency of the wipe procedure (the fraction of non-fixed contamination 
transferred from the surface to the absorbent material), may not exceed the 
limits set forth in Table 9 at any time during transport. For this purpose the 
actual wipe efficiency may be used, or the wipe efficiency may be assumed to be 
0.10; or
(ii) Alternatively, the level of non-fixed contamination may be determined by 
using other methods of equal or greater efficiency.

(2) A conveyance used for non-exclusive use shipments is not required to be 
surveyed unless there is reason to suspect that it may exhibit contamination.

(b) In the case of packages transported as exclusive use shipments by rail or 
public highway only, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, at any 
time during transport the non-fixed contamination on the external surface of any 
package, as well as on the associated accessible internal surfaces of any 
conveyance, overpack, or freight container, may not exceed ten times the levels 
prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section. The levels at the beginning of 
transport may not exceed the levels prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) Except as provided in paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, each 
conveyance, overpack, freight container, tank, or intermediate bulk container 
used for transporting Class 7 (radioactive) materials as an exclusive use 
shipment that utilizes the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section, 
§ 173.427(b)(4), or § 173.427(c) must be surveyed with appropriate radiation 
detection instruments after each exclusive use transport. Except as provided in 
paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, these items may not be returned to Class 
7 (radioactive) materials exclusive use transport service, and then only for a 
subsequent exclusive use shipment utilizing one of the above cited provisions, 
unless the radiation dose rate at each accessible surface is 0.005 mSv per hour 
(0.5 mrem per hour) or less, and there is no significant non-fixed surface 
contamination as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The requirements of 
this paragraph do not address return to service of items outside of the above 
cited provisions.

(d) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section do not apply to any closed transport 
vehicle used solely for the exclusive use transportation by highway or rail of 
Class 7 (radioactive) material with contamination levels that do not exceed ten 
times the levels prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section if—

(1) A survey of the interior surfaces of the empty vehicle shows that the 
radiation dose rate at any point does not exceed 0.1 mSv/h (10 mrem/h) at the 
surface or 0.02 mSv/h (2 mrem/h) at 1 m (3.3 feet) from the surface;

(2) Each vehicle is marked (e.g. stenciled) with the words “For Radioactive 
Materials Use Only” in letters at least 76 millimeters (3 inches) high in a 
conspicuous place on both sides of the exterior of the vehicle; and

(3) Each vehicle is kept closed except for loading or unloading; and

(4) Each vehicle is placarded in accordance with subpart F of part 172 of this 
subchapter.

(e) If it is evident that a package of radioactive material, or conveyance 
carrying unpackaged radioactive material, is leaking, or if it is suspected that 
the package, or conveyance carrying unpackaged material, may have leaked, access 
to the package or conveyance must be restricted and, as soon as possible, the 
extent of contamination and the resultant radiation level of the package or 
conveyance must be assessed. The scope of the assessment must include, as 
applicable, the package, the conveyance, the adjacent loading and unloading 
areas, and, if necessary, all other material which has been carried in the 
conveyance. When necessary, additional steps for the protection of persons, 
property, and the environment must be taken to overcome and minimize the 
consequences of such leakage. Packages, and conveyances carrying unpackaged 
material, which are leaking radioactive contents in excess of limits for normal 
conditions of transport may be removed to an interim location under supervision, 
but must not be forwarded until repaired or reconditioned and decontaminated, or 
as approved by the Associate Administrator.

§ 173.461

Demonstration of compliance with tests.

(a) Compliance with the design requirements in § 173.412 and the test 
requirements in §§ 173.465 through 173.469 must be shown by any of the methods 
prescribed in this paragraph, or by a combination of these methods appropriate 
for the particular feature being evaluated:

(1) Performance of tests with prototypes or samples of the specimens 
representing LSA-III, special form Class 7 (radioactive) material, or packaging, 
in which case the contents of the packaging for the test must simulate as 
closely as practicable the expected range of physical properties of the 
radioactive contents or packaging to be tested, must be prepared as normally 
presented for transport. The use of non-radioactive substitute contents is 
encouraged provided that the results of the testing take into account the 
radioactive characteristics of the contents for which the package is being 
tested;

(2) Reference to a previous, satisfactory demonstration of compliance of a 
sufficiently similar nature;

(3) Performance of tests with models of appropriate scale incorporating those 
features that are significant with respect to the item under investigation, when 
engineering experience has shown results of those tests to be suitable for 
design purposes. When a scale model is used, the need for adjusting certain test 
parameters, such as the 
penetrator diameter or the compressive load, must be taken into account; or
(4) Calculations or reasoned evaluation, using reliable and conservative 
procedures and parameters.

(b) With respect to the initial conditions for the tests under §§ 173.465 
through 173.469, except for the water immersion tests, compliance must be based 
upon the assumption that the package is in equilibrium at an ambient temperature 
of 38 °C (100 °F).

§ 173.462

Preparation of specimens for testing.

(a) Each specimen (i.e., sample, prototype or scale model) must be examined 
before testing to identify and record faults or damage, including:

(1) Divergence from the specifications or drawings;

(2) Defects in construction;

(3) Corrosion or other deterioration; and

(4) Distortion of features.

(b) Any deviation found under paragraph (a) of this section from the specified 
design must be corrected or appropriately taken into account in the subsequent 
evaluation.

(c) The containment system of the packaging must be clearly specified.

(d) The external features of the specimen must be clearly identified so that 
reference may be made to any part of it.


§ 173.465

Type A packaging tests.

(a) The packaging, with contents, must be capable of withstanding the water 
spray, free drop, stacking and penetration tests prescribed in this section. One 
prototype may be used for all tests if the requirements of paragraph (b) of this 
section are met. The tests are successful if the requirements of § 173.412(j) 
are met.

(b) 
Water spray test.
The water spray test must precede each test or test sequence prescribed in this 
section. The water spray test must simulate exposure to rainfall of 
approximately 5 cm (2 inches) per hour for at least one hour. The time interval 
between the end of the water spray test and the beginning of the next test must 
be such that the water has soaked in to the maximum extent without appreciable 
drying of the exterior of the specimen. In the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, this interval may be assumed to be two hours if the water spray is 
applied from four different directions simultaneously. However, no time interval 
may elapse if the water spray is applied from each of the four directions 
consecutively.
(c) 
Free drop test.
The specimen must drop onto the target so as to suffer maximum damage to the 
safety features being tested, and:
(1) The height of the drop measured from the lowest point of the specimen to the 
upper surface of the target may not be less than the distance specified in table 
10, for the applicable package mass. The target must be as specified in 
§ 173.465(c)(5). Table 10 is as follows:

(2) For packages containing fissile material, the free drop test specified in 
paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be preceded by a free drop from a height 
of 0.3 m (1 foot) on each corner, or in the case of cylindrical packages, onto 
each of the quarters of each rim.

(3) For fiberboard or wood rectangular packages with a mass of 50 kg (110 
pounds) or less, a separate specimen must be subjected to a free drop onto each 
corner from a height of 0.3 m (1 foot).

(4) For cylindrical fiberboard packages with a mass of 100 kg (220 pounds) or 
less, a separate specimen must be subjected to a free drop onto each of the 
quarters of each rim from a height of 0.3 m (1 foot).

(5) The target for the free drop test must be a flat, horizontal surface of such 
mass and rigidity that any increase in its resistance to displacement or 
deformation upon impact by the 
specimen would not significantly increase the damage to the specimen.
(d) 
Stacking test.
(1) The specimen must be subjected for a period of at least 24 hours to a 
compressive load equivalent to the greater of the following:
(i) A total weight equal to five times the maximum weight of the package; or

(ii) The equivalent of 13 kilopascals (1.9 psi) multiplied by the vertically 
projected area of the package.

(2) The compressive load must be applied uniformly to two opposite sides of the 
specimen, one of which must be the base on which the package would normally 
rest.

(e) 
Penetration test.
For the penetration test, the specimen must be placed on a rigid, flat, 
horizontal surface that will not move significantly while the test is being 
performed.
(1) A bar of 3.2 cm (1.25 inches) in diameter with a hemispherical end and a 
mass of 6 kg (13.2 pounds) must be dropped and directed to fall with its 
longitudinal axis vertical, onto the center of the weakest part of the specimen, 
so that, if it penetrates far enough, it will hit the containment system. The 
bar may not be significantly deformed by the test; and

(2) The height of the drop of the bar measured from its lower end to the 
intended point of impact on the upper surface of the specimen must be 1 m (3.3 
feet) or greater.

Test for LSA-III material.

(a) LSA-III Class 7 (radioactive) material must meet the test requirement of 
paragraph (b) of this section. Any differences between the material to be 
transported and the test material must be taken into account in determining 
whether the test requirements have been met.

(b) 
Test method.
(1) The specimen representing no less than the entire contents of the package 
must be immersed for 7 days in water at ambient temperature.
(2) The volume of water to be used in the test must be sufficient to ensure that 
at the end of the test period the free volume of the unabsorbed and unreacted 
water remaining will be at least 10% of the volume of the specimen itself.

(3) The water must have an initial pH of 6-8 and a maximum conductivity of 10 
micromho/cm at 20 °C (68 °F).

(4) The total activity of the free volume of water must be measured following 
the 7 day immersion test and must not exceed 0.1 A

§ 173.469

Tests for special form Class 7 (radioactive) materials.

(a) Special form Class 7 (radioactive) materials must meet the test requirements 
of paragraph (b) of this section. Each solid Class 7 (radioactive) material or 
capsule specimen to be tested must be manufactured or fabricated so 
that it is representative of the actual solid material or capsule that will be 
transported with the proposed radioactive content duplicated as closely as 
practicable. Any differences between the material to be transported and the test 
material, such as the use of non-radioactive contents, must be taken into 
account in determining whether the test requirements have been met. The 
following additional conditions apply:
(1) A different specimen may be used for each of the tests;

(2) The specimen may not break or shatter when subjected to the impact, 
percussion, or bending tests;

(3) The specimen may not melt or disperse when subjected to the heat test; and

(4) After each test, leaktightness or indispersibility of the specimen must be 
determined by—

(i) A method no less sensitive than the leaching assessment prescribed in 
paragraph (c) of this section. For a capsule resistant to corrosion by water, 
and which has an internal void volume greater than 0.1 milliliter, an 
alternative to the leaching assessment is a demonstration of leaktightness of 10

/s) based on air at 25 °C (77 °F) and one atmosphere differential pressure for 
solid radioactive content, or 10
−6
torr-1/s (1.3 × 10
−6
atm-cm
3
/s) for liquid or gaseous radioactive content; or
(ii) A specimen that comprises or simulates Class 7 (radioactive) material 
contained in a sealed capsule need not be subjected to the leaching assessment 
specified in paragraph (c) of this section provided it is alternatively 
subjected to any of the volumetric leakage assessment tests prescribed in the 
International Organization for Standardization document ISO 9978-1992(E): 
“Radiation protection—Sealed radioactive sources—Leakage test methods” (IBR, see 
§ 171.7 of this subchapter).

Appendix A to Part 173 [Reserved]


Pt. 173, App. B

Appendix B to Part 173—Procedure for Testing Chemical Compatibility and Rate of 
Permeation in Plastic Packaging and Receptacles

1. The purpose of this procedure is to determine the chemical compatibility and 
permeability of liquid hazardous materials packaged in plastic packaging and 
receptacles. Alternatives for this procedure are permitted as specified in 
§ 173.24(e)(3)(iii) of this subchapter.

2. Compatibility and rate of permeation are determined by subjecting full size 
plastic containers (or smaller containers as permitted in paragraph 4 of this 
appendix) and hazardous material lading to one of the following combinations of 
time and temperature:

a. Test Method 1: 180 days at a temperature no lower than 18 °C. (64 °F.)

b. Test Method 2: 28 days at a temperature no lower than 50 °C. (122 °F.)

c. Test Method 3: 14 days at a temperature no lower than 60 °C. (140 °F.)

3. Regardless of which test method is used, at least three sample containers 
shall be tested for each combination of hazardous material and size and design 
of container. Fill containers to rated capacity with the specific hazardous 
material (at the concentration to be transported) and close as for shipment. For 
the first and last 24 hours of storage under the selected test method, place the 
containers with closures downward, except that containers fitted with a vent are 
so placed on each occasion for five minutes only.

4. For testing under Test Method 2 or 3 in those instances where it is not 
practicable to use full size containers, smaller containers may be used. The 
small container shall be manufactured by the same process as the larger 
container (for example, using the same method of molding and processing 
temperatures) and be made of identical resins, pigments and additives.

5. Determine filled container weight or net weight of contents both before and 
after storage under the selected test method. Rate of permeation is determined 
from loss of hazardous materials contents, during the conduct of the test, 
expressed as a percentage of the original weight.

6. After storage under the selected test method, the container shall be drained, 
rinsed, filled to rated capacity with water and, with filled container at 
ambient temperature, dropped from a height determined in accordance with 
§ 178.603(e) of this subchapter onto a rigid non-resilient, flat and horizontal 
surface.

7. Each of the following constitute test failure:

a. Visible evidence of permanent deformation due to vapor pressure build-up or 
collapse of walls, deterioration, swelling, crazing, cracking, excessive 
corrosion, oxidization, embrittlement, leakage, rupture or other defects likely 
to cause premature failure or a hazardous condition.

b. For materials meeting the definition of a poison according to this 
subchapter, a rate of permeation in excess of 0.5% determined over the test 
period. For all other hazardous materials, a rate of permeation in excess of 
2.0% determined over the test period.

Appendix C to Part 173—Procedure for Base-level Vibration Testing

Base-level vibration testing shall be conducted as follows:

1. Three sample packagings, selected at random, must be filled and closed as for 
shipment. A non-hazardous material may be used in place of the hazardous 
material if it has essentially the same physical characteristics.

2. The three packages must be placed on a vibrating platform that has a vertical 
double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one inch. The packages should be 
constrained horizontally to prevent them from falling off the platform, but must 
be left free to move vertically, bounce and rotate.

3. The test must be performed continuously for one hour at a frequency that 
causes each package to be raised from the vibrating platform to such a degree 
that a piece of material of approximately 1.6 mm (0.063 inch) thickness (such as 
steel strapping or paperboard) can be passed between the bottom of any package 
and the platform.

4. Immediately following the period of vibration, each package shall be removed 
from the platform, turned on its side and observed for any evidence of leakage.

5. Rupture or leakage from any of the packages constitutes failure of the test.

of the glass tube;

(b) Place a small amount of absorbent cotton on top of the plug;

(c) Place a plastic disk that matches the inner diameter to the glass tube and 
has seven small perforations on top of the cotton; and

(d) Place 10 g (0.35 ounce) of the dynamite sample on top of the disk. 

The assembled glass tube is then placed in a hand-operated centrifuge and spun 
for one minute at 600 rpm (revolutions per minute). The dynamite sample is then 
removed from the glass tube and weighed to determine the percent of weight loss.

3. Test method D-3—
Compression Exudation Test

The entire apparatus for this test is shown in Figure 1 of this appendix. The 
test is conducted using the following procedures:

(a) A glass tube, 135 mm (5.3 inches) long and one inch in diameter, is held on 
a wooden base;

(b) A small amount of absorbent cotton is placed into the bottom of the glass 
tube;

(c) Ten g (0.35 ounce) of dynamite sample are placed on top of the cotton in the 
glass tube;

(d) A small amount of absorbent cotton is placed on top of the dynamite sample;

(e) A plastic disk that matches the inner diameter of the glass tube and has 
seven small perforations is placed on top of the cotton;

(f) A plastic plug matching the inner diameter of the glass tube is then placed 
on top of the disk;

(g) The glass tube assembly is placed under the compression rod, and compression 
is applied by means of the weight on the metal lever rod. The sample is 
compressed for one minute; and

(h) The dynamite sample is then removed from the glass tube and weighed to 
determine the percent of weight loss.

Pt. 173, App. H

Appendix H to Part 173—Method of Testing for Sustained Combustibility

1. Method

The method describes a procedure for determining if the material when heated 
under the test conditions and exposed to an external source of flame applied in 
a standard manner sustains combustion.

2. Principle of the method

A metal block with a concave depression (test portion well) is heated to a 
specified temperature. A specified volume of the material under test is 
transferred to the well, and its ability to sustain combustion is noted after 
application and subsequent removal of a standard flame under specified 
conditions.

3. Apparatus

A combustibility tester consisting of a block of aluminum alloy or other 
corrosion-resistant metal of high thermal conductivity is used. The block has a 
concave well and a pocket drilled to take a thermometer. A small gas jet 
assembly on a swivel is attached to the block. The handle and gas inlet for the 
gas jet may be fitted at any convenient angle to the gas jet. A suitable 
apparatus is shown in Figure 32.5.2.1 of the UN Manual of Test and Criteria 
(IBR, see (171.7 of this subchapter), and the essential dimensions are given in 
Figures 32.5.2.1 and 32.5.2.2 of the UN Manual and Tests and Criteria. The 
following equipment is needed:

(a) 
Gauge,
for checking that the height of the center of the gas jet above the top of the 
test portion well is 2.2 mm (
see
Figure 32.5.2.1);
(b) 
Thermometer,
mercury in glass, for horizontal operation, with a sensitivity not less than 1 
mm/ °C, or other measuring device of equivalent sensitivity permitting reading 
at 0.5 °C intervals. When in position in the block, the thermometer bulb must be 
surrounded with thermally conducting thermoplastic compound;
(c) 
Hotplate,
fitted with a temperature-control device. (Other types of apparatus with 
suitable temperature-control facilities may be employed to heat the metal 
block);
(d) 
Stopwatch,
or other suitable timing device;
(e) 
Syringe,
capable of delivering 2 mL to an accuracy of ±0.1 mL; and
(f) 
Fuel source,
butane test fuel.
4. Sampling

The sample must be representative of the material to be tested and must be 
supplied and kept in a tightly closed container prior to test. Because of the 
possibility of loss of volatile constituents, the sample must receive only the 
minimum treatment necessary to ensure its homogeneity. After removing each test 
portion, the sample container must be immediately closed tightly to ensure that 
no volatile components escape from the container; if this closure is incomplete, 
an entirely new sample must be taken.

5. Procedure

Carry out the determination in triplicate.


WARNING
—Do not carry out the test in a small confined area (for example a glove box) 
because of the hazard of explosions.
(a) It is essential that the apparatus be set up in a completely draft-free area 
(see warning) and in the absence of strong light to facilitate observation of 
flash, flame, etc.

(b) Place the metal block on the hotplate or heat the metal block by other 
suitable means so that its temperature, as indicated by the thermometer placed 
in the metal block, is maintained at the specified temperature within a 
tolerance of ±1 °C. For the appropriate test temperature, see paragraph 5.(h) of 
this appendix. Correct this temperature for the difference in barometric 
pressure from the standard atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa) by raising the test 
temperature for a higher pressure or lowering the test temperature for a lower 
pressure by 1.0 °C for each 4 kPa difference. Ensure that the top of the metal 
block is exactly horizontal. Use the gauge to check that the jet is 2.2 mm above 
the top of the well when in the test position.

(c) Light the butane test fuel with the jet away from the test position (i.e. in 
the “off” position, away from the well). Adjust the size of the flame so that it 
is 8 mm to 9 mm high and approximately 5 mm wide.

(d) Using the syringe, take from the sample container at least 2 mL of the 
sample and rapidly transfer a test portion of 2 mL ±0.1 mL to the well of the 
combustibility tester and immediately start the timing device.

(e) After a heating time of 60 seconds (s), by which time the test portion is 
deemed to have reached its equilibrium temperature, and if the test fluid has 
not ignited, swing the test flame into the test position over the edge of the 
pool of liquid. Maintain it in this position for 15 s and then return it to the 
“off” position while observing the behavior of the test portion. The test flame 
must remain lighted throughout the test.

(f) For each test observe and record:

(i) whether there is ignition and sustained combustion or flashing, or neither, 
of the test portion before the test flame is moved into the test position;

(ii) whether the test portion ignites while the test flame is in the test 
position, and, if so, how long combustion is sustained after 
the test flame is returned to the “off” position.
(g) If sustained combustion interpreted in accordance with paragraph 6. of this 
appendix is not found, repeat the complete procedure with new test portions, but 
with a heating time of 30 s.

(h) If sustained combustion interpreted in accordance with paragraph 6. of this 
appendix is not found at a test temperature of 60 °C (140 °F), repeat the 
complete procedure with new test portions, but at a test temperature of 75 °C 
(167 °F). In the case of a material which has a flash point above 60 °C (140 °F) 
and below 93 °C (200 °F), if sustained combustion interpreted in accordance with 
paragraph 6. of this appendix is not found at a test temperature of 5 °C (9 °F) 
above its flash point, repeat the complete procedure with new test portions, but 
at a test temperature of 20 °C (36 °F) above its flash point.

6. Interpretation of observations

The material must be assessed either as not sustaining combustion or as 
sustaining combustion. Sustained combustion must be reported at either of the 
heating times if one of the following occurs with either of the test portions:

(a) When the test flame is in the “off” position, the test portion ignites and 
sustains combustion;

(b) The test portion ignites while the test flame is in the test position for 15 
s, and sustains combustion for more than 15 s after the test flame has been 
returned to the “off” position. 


Note to paragraph 6 of this appendix:

Intermittent flashing may not be interpreted as sustained combustion. Normally, 
at the end of 15 s, the combustion has either clearly ceased or continues. In 
cases of doubt, the material must be deemed to sustain combustion.

Purpose and scope.

This part prescribes requirements in addition to those contained in parts 171, 
172, 173, and 179 of this subchapter, to be observed with respect to the 
transportation of hazardous materials in or on rail cars.

[Amdt. 174-26, 41 FR 16092, Apr. 15, 1976, as amended by Amdt. 174-26A, 41 FR 
40685, Sept. 20, 1976; Amdt. 174-74, 58 FR 51533, Oct. 1, 1993]


§ 174.2

Limitation on actions by states, local governments, and Indian tribes.

Sections 5125 and 20106 of Title 49, United States Code, limit the authority of 
states, political subdivisions of states, and Indian tribes to impose 
requirements on the transportation of hazardous materials in commerce. A state, 
local, or Indian tribe requirement on the transportation of hazardous materials 
by rail may be preempted under either 49 U.S.C. 5125 or 20106, or both.

(a) Section 171.1(f) of this subchapter describes the circumstances under which 
49 U.S.C. 5125 preempts a requirement of a state, political subdivision of a 
state, or Indian tribe.

(b) Under the Federal Railroad Safety Act (49 U.S.C. 20106), administered by the 
Federal Railroad Administration (
see
49 CFR parts 200 through 244), laws, regulations and orders related to railroad 
safety, including security, shall be nationally uniform to the extent 
practicable. A state may adopt, or continue in force, a law, regulation, or 
order covering the same subject matter as a DOT regulation or order applicable 
to railroad safety and security (including the requirements in this subpart) 
only when an additional or more stringent state law, regulation, or order is 
necessary to eliminate or reduce an essentially local safety or security hazard; 
is not incompatible with a law, regulation, or order of the United States 
Government; and does not unreasonably burden interstate commerce.
[74 FR 1801, Jan. 13, 2009]


§ 174.3

Unacceptable hazardous materials shipments.

No person may accept for transportation or transport by rail any shipment of 
hazardous material that is not in conformance with the requirements of this 
subchapter.

[Amdt. 174-83, 61 FR 28677, June 5, 1996]


§ 174.5

Carrier's materials and supplies.

This subchapter applies to the transportation of a carrier's materials and 
supplies moving by rail, except that 
the shipper's certification is not required when these materials and supplies 
are being transported by the carrier who owns them. The requirements of this 
subchapter do not apply to railway torpedoes or fusees when carried in engines 
or rail cars. Railway torpedoes must be in closed metal boxes when not in use.
[Amdt. 174-26B, 41 FR 57071, Dec. 30, 1976]


§ 174.9

Safety and security inspection and acceptance.

(a) At each location where a hazardous material is accepted for transportation 
or placed in a train, the carrier must inspect each rail car containing the 
hazardous material, at ground level, for required markings, labels, placards, 
securement of closures, and leakage. These inspections may be performed in 
conjunction with inspections required under parts 215 and 232 of this title.

(b) For each rail car containing an amount of hazardous material requiring 
placarding in accordance with § 172.504 of this subchapter, the carrier must 
visually inspect the rail car at ground level for signs of tampering, including 
closures and seals, for suspicious items or items that do not belong, and for 
other signs that the security of the car may have been compromised, including 
the presence of an improvised explosive device. As used in this section, an 
improvised explosive device is a device fabricated in an improvised manner 
incorporating explosives or destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or 
incendiary chemicals in its design, and generally includes a power supply, a 
switch or timer, and a detonator or initiator. The carrier should be 
particularly attentive to signs that security may have been compromised on rail 
cars transporting materials covered by § 172.820 of this subchapter, rail 
carload quantities of ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrate mixtures in solid 
form, or hazardous materials of interest based on current threat information.

(c) If a rail car does not conform to the safety and security requirements of 
this subchapter, the carrier may not forward or transport the rail car until the 
deficiencies are corrected or the car is approved for movement in accordance 
with § 174.50.

(d) Where an indication of tampering or suspicious item is found, a carrier must 
take appropriate action to ensure the security of the rail car and its contents 
have not been compromised before accepting the rail car for further movement. If 
the carrier determines that the security of the rail car has been compromised, 
the carrier must take action, in conformance with its existing security plan 
(see subpart I of part 172 of this subchapter) to address the security issues 
before forwarding the rail car for further movement.

[73 FR 20773, Apr. 16, 2008]


§ 174.14

Movements to be expedited.

(a) A carrier must forward each shipment of hazardous materials promptly and 
within 48 hours (Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays excluded), after acceptance at 
the originating point or receipt at any yard, transfer station, or interchange 
point, except that where biweekly or weekly service only is performed, a 
shipment of hazardous materials must be forwarded on the first available train.

(b) A tank car loaded with any Division 2.1 (flammable gas), Division 2.3 
(poisonous gas) or Class 3 (flammable liquid) material, may not be received and 
held at any point, subject to forwarding orders, so as to defeat the purpose of 
this section or of § 174.204 of this subchapter.

[Amdt. 174-26, 41 FR 16092, Apr. 15, 1976, as amended by Amdt. 174-68, 55 FR 
52677, Dec. 21, 1990]


§ 174.16

Removal and disposition of hazardous materials at destination.

(a) 
Delivery at non-agency stations.
A shipment of Class 1 (explosive) materials may not be unloaded at non-agency 
stations unless the consignee is there to receive it or unless properly locked 
and secure storage facilities are provided at that point for its protection. If 
delivery cannot be so made, the shipment must be taken to next or nearest agency 
station for delivery.
(b) 
Delivery at agency stations.
A carrier shall require the consignee of each 
shipment of hazardous materials to remove the shipment from carrier's property 
within 48 hours (exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays) after notice of 
arrival has been sent or given. If not so removed, the carrier shall immediately 
dispose of the shipments as follows:
(1) 
Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials:
If safe storage is available, by storage at the owner's expense; if safe storage 
is not available, by return to the shipper, sale, or destruction under 
supervision of a competent person; or if safety requires, by destruction under 
supervision of a competent person.
(2) 
Hazardous materials, except Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials, in 
carload shipments:
By storage on the carrier's property; by storage on other than the carrier's 
property, if safe storage on the carrier's property is not available; or by sale 
at expiration of 15 calendar days after notice of arrival has been sent or given 
to the consignee, provided the consignor has been notified of the non-delivery 
at the expiration of a 48-hour period and orders for disposition have not been 
received.
(3) 
Hazardous materials, except Division 1.1 or 1.2 (Class A explosive) materials, 
in less-than-carload shipments:
By return to the shipper if notice of non-delivery was requested and given the 
consignor as prescribed by the carrier's tariff, and orders for return to 
shipper have been received; by storage on the carrier's property; by storage on 
other than the carrier's property, if safe storage on carrier's property is not 
available; or by sale at expiration of 15 calendar days after notice of arrival 
has been sent or given to the consignee, provided the consignor has been 
notified of non-delivery at expiration of a 48-hour period and orders for 
disposition have not been received.

§ 174.20

Local or carrier restrictions.

(a) When local conditions make the acceptance, transportation, or delivery of 
hazardous materials unusually hazardous, local restrictions may be imposed by 
the carrier.

(b) Each carrier must report to the Bureau of Explosives for publication the 
full information as to any restrictions which it imposes against the acceptance, 
delivery, or transportation of hazardous materials, over any portion of its 
lines under this section.

[Amdt. 174-26, 41 FR 16092, Apr. 15, 1976]


Subpart B—General Operating Requirements


§ 174.24

Shipping papers.

(a) A person may not accept a hazardous material for transportation or transport 
a hazardous material by rail unless that person receives a shipping paper 
prepared in accordance with part 172 of this subchapter, unless the material is 
excepted from shipping paper requirements under this subchapter. Only an initial 
carrier within the United States must receive and retain a copy of the shipper's 
certification as required by § 172.204 of this subchapter. This section does not 
apply to a material that is excepted from shipping paper requirements by this 
subchapter.

(b) Each person receiving a shipping paper required by this section must retain 
a copy or an electronic image thereof, that is accessible at or through its 
principal place of business and must make the shipping paper available, upon 
request, to an authorized official of a Federal, State, or local government 
agency at reasonable times and locations. For a hazardous waste, each shipping 
paper copy must be retained for three years after the material is accepted by 
the initial carrier. For all other hazardous materials, each shipping paper copy 
must be retained for one year after the material is accepted by the initial 
carrier. Each shipping paper copy must include the date of acceptance by the 
initial carrier. The date on the shipping paper may be the date a shipper 
notifies the rail carrier that a shipment is ready for transportation, as 
indicated on the waybill or bill of lading, as an alternative to the date the 
shipment is picked up, or accepted, by the carrier.

[67 FR 46128, July 12, 2002, as amended at 67 FR 66574, Nov. 1, 2002; 70 FR 
73165, Dec. 9, 2005]



§ 174.26

Notice to train crews.

(a) The train crew must have a document that reflects the current position in 
the train of each rail car containing a hazardous material. The train crew must 
update the document to indicate changes in the placement of a rail car within 
the train. For example, the train crew may update the document by handwriting on 
it or by appending or attaching another document to it.

(b) A member of the crew of a train transporting a hazardous material must have 
a copy of a document for the hazardous material being transported showing the 
information required by part 172 of this subchapter, including the requirements 
in § 172.604(b) applicable to emergency response information.

[Amdt. 174-84, 62 FR 1236, Jan. 8, 1997, as amended at 74 FR 53423, Oct. 19, 
2009]


§ 174.50

Nonconforming or leaking packages.

A leaking non-bulk package may not be forwarded until repaired, reconditioned, 
or overpacked in accordance with § 173.3 of this subchapter. Except as otherwise 
provided in this section, a bulk packaging that no longer conforms to this 
subchapter may not be forwarded by rail unless repaired or approved for movement 
by the Associate Administrator for Safety, Federal Railroad Administration. 
Notification and approval must be in writing, or through telephonic or 
electronic means, with subsequent written confirmation provided within two 
weeks. For the applicable address and telephone number, see § 107.117(d)(4) of 
this chapter. A leaking bulk package containing a hazardous material may be 
moved without repair or approval only so far as necessary to reduce or to 
eliminate an immediate threat or harm to human health or to the environment when 
it is determined its movement would provide greater safety than allowing the 
package to remain in place. In the case of a liquid leak, measures must be taken 
to prevent the spread of liquid.

[65 FR 50462, Aug. 18, 2000]


Subpart C—General Handling and Loading Requirements


§ 174.55

General requirements.

(a) Each package containing a hazardous material being transported by rail in a 
freight container or transport vehicle must be loaded so that it cannot fall or 
slide and must be safeguarded in such a manner that other freight cannot fall 
onto or slide into it under conditions normally incident to transportation. When 
this protection cannot be provided by using other freight, it must be provided 
by blocking and bracing. For examples of blocking and bracing in freight 
containers and transport vehicles, see Bureau of Explosives Pamphlet No. 6 and 
the Intermodal Loading Guide for Products in Closed Trailers and Containers 
(IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(b) Each package containing a hazardous material bearing package orientation 
markings prescribed in § 172.312 of this subchapter must be loaded within a 
transport vehicle or freight container to remain in the correct position 
indicated by those markings during transportation.

(c) The doors of a freight container or transport vehicle may not be used to 
secure a load that includes a package containing a hazardous material unless the

Transport vehicles and freight containers on flat cars.

(a) A transport vehicle, freight container, or package containing a hazardous 
material must be designed and loaded so that it will not become damaged to an 
extent that would affect its integrity under conditions normally incident to 
transportation. Each unit must be secured on a flatcar so that it cannot 
permanently change position during transit. Packages of hazardous materials 
contained therein must be loaded and braced as provided by §§ 174.101, 174.112, 
174.115 and 174.55. Placards must be applied when prescribed by part 172 of this 
subchapter and part 174.

(b) Except as specified in § 173.21, a truck body, trailer, or freight container 
equipped with heating or refrigerating equipment which has fuel or any article 
classed as a hazardous material may be loaded and transported on a flat car as 
part of a joint rail highway movement. The heating or refrigerating equipment is 
considered to be a part of the truck body or trailer and is not subject to any 
other requirements of this subchapter. The truck body, trailer, or freight 
container must be secured on the flatcar so that it cannot change position 
during transit.

§ 174.67

Tank car unloading.

For transloading operations, the following rules must be observed:

(a) 
General requirements.
(1) Unloading operations must be performed by hazmat employees properly 
instructed in unloading hazardous materials and made responsible for compliance 
with this section.
(2) Each hazmat employee who is responsible for unloading must apply the 
handbrake and block at least one wheel to prevent movement in any direction. If 
multiple tank cars are coupled together, sufficient hand brakes must be set and 
wheels blocked to prevent movement in both directions.

(3) Each hazmat employee who is responsible for unloading must secure access to 
the track to prevent entry by other rail equipment, including motorized service 
vehicles. This requirement may be satisfied by lining each switch providing 
access to the unloading area against movement and securing each switch with an 
effective locking device, or by using derails, portable bumper blocks, or other 
equipment that provides and equivalent level of safety.

(4) Each hazmat employee who is responsible for unloading must display caution 
signs on the track or on the tank cars to warn persons approaching the cars from 
the open end of the track and must be left up until after all closures are 
secured and the cars are in proper condition for transportation. The caution 
signs must be of metal or other durable material, rectangular, at 30.48 cm (12 
inches) high by 38.10 cm (15 inches) wide, and bear the word “STOP.” The word 
“STOP” must appear in letters at least 10.16 cm (4 inches) high. The letters 
must be white on a blue background. Additional words, such as “Tank Car 
Connected” or “Crew at Work,” may also appear in white letters under the word 
“STOP.”

(5) The transloading facility operator must maintain written safety procedures 
(such as those it may already be required to maintain pursuant to the Department 
of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements in 29 CFR 
1910.119 and 1910.120) in a location where they are immediately available to 
hazmat employees responsible for the transloading operation.

(6) Before a manhole cover or outlet valve cap is removed from a tank car, the 
car must be relieved of all interior pressure by cooling the tank with water or 
by venting the tank by raising the safety valve or opening the dome vent at 
short intervals. However, if venting to relieve pressure will cause a dangerous 
amount of vapor to collect outside the car, venting and unloading must be 
deferred until the pressure is reduced by allowing the car to stand overnight, 
otherwise cooling the contents, or venting to a closed collection system. These 
precautions are not necessary when the car is equipped with a manhole cover 
which hinges inward or with an inner manhole cover which does not have to be 
removed to unload the car, and when pressure is relieved 
by piping vapor into a condenser or storage tank.
(b) After the pressure is released, for unloading processes that require the 
removal of the manhole cover, the seal must be broken and the manhole cover 
removed as follows:

(1) 
Screw type.
The cover must be loosened by placing a bar between the manhole cover lug and 
knob. After two complete turns, so that the vent openings are exposed, the 
operation must be stopped, and if there is any sound of escaping vapor, the 
cover must be screwed down tightly and the interior pressure relieved as 
prescribed in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, before again attempting to 
remove the cover.
(2) 
Hinged and bolted type.
All nuts must be unscrewed one complete turn, after which same precautions as 
prescribed for screw type cover must be observed.
(3) 
Interior type.
All dirt and cinders must be carefully removed from around the cover before the 
yoke is unscrewed.
(c) When the car is unloaded through a bottom outlet valve, for unloading 
processes that require the removal of the manhole cover, the manhole cover must 
be adjusted as follows:

(1) 
Screw type.
The cover must be put in place, but not entirely screwed down, so that air may 
enter the tank through the vent holes in threaded flange of the cover.
(2) 
Hinged and bolted type.
A non-metallic block must be placed under one edge of the cover.
(3) 
Interior type.
The screw must be tightened up in the yoke so that the cover is brought up 
within one-half inch of the closed position.
(d) When unloading through the bottom outlet of a car equipped with an interior 
manhole type cover, and in each case where unloading is done through the manhole 
(unless a special cover with a safety vent opening and a tight connection for 
the discharge outlet is used), the manhole must be protected by asbestos or 
metal covers against the entrance of sparks or other sources of ignition of 
vapor, or by being covered and surrounded with wet burlap or similar cloth 
material. The burlap or other cloth must be kept damp by the replacement or the 
application of water as needed.

(e) Seals or other substances must not be thrown into the tank and the contents 
may not be spilled over the car or tank.

(f) The valve rod handle or control in the dome must be operated several times 
to see that outlet valve in bottom of tank is on its seat before valve cap is 
removed.

(g) The valve cap, or the reducer when a large outlet is to be used, must be 
removed with a suitable wrench after the set screws are loosened and a pail must 
be placed in position to catch any liquid that may be in the outlet chamber. If 
the valve cap or reducer does not unscrew easily, it may be tapped lightly with 
a mallet or wooden block in an upward direction. If leakage shows upon starting 
the removal, the cap or reducer may not be entirely unscrewed. Sufficient 
threads must be left engaged and sufficient time allowed to permit the 
controlled escape of any accumulation of liquid in the outlet chamber. If the 
leakage stops or the rate of leakage diminishes materially, the cap or reducer 
may be entirely removed. If the initial rate of leakage continues, further 
efforts must be made to seat the outlet valve (see paragraph (f) of this 
section). If this fails, the cap or reducer must be screwed up tight and the 
tank must be unloaded through the dome. If upon removal of the outlet cap the 
outlet chamber is found to be blocked with frozen liquid or any other matter, 
the cap must be replaced immediately and a careful examination must be made to 
determine whether the outlet casting has been cracked. If the obstruction is not 
frozen liquid, the car must be unloaded through the dome. If the obstruction is 
frozen liquid and no crack has been found in the outlet casting, the car may, if 
circumstances require it, be unloaded from the bottom by removing the cap and 
attaching unloading connections immediately. Before opening the valve inside the 
tank car with a frozen liquid blockage:

(1) Steam must be applied to the outside of the outlet casting or the outlet 
casting must be wrapped with burlap or other rags and hot water applied to the 
wrapped casting to melt the frozen liquid; or

(2) For combustible liquid or Class 3 liquid petroleum distillate fuels, the 
blockage may be cleared by attaching a fitting to the outlet line and applying 
nitrogen at a pressure not to exceed 100 psig.

(h) Unloading connections must be securely attached to unloading pipes on the 
dome or to the bottom discharge outlets before any discharge valves are opened.

(i) Throughout the entire period of unloading and while a tank car has unloading 
equipment attached, the facility operator must assure that the tank car is:

(1) Attended by a designated hazmat employee who is physically present and who 
has an unobstructed view of the unloading operation; or

(2) Monitored by a signaling system (
e.g.,
video system, sensing equipment, or mechanical equipment) that is observed by a 
designated hazmat employee located either in the immediate area of the tank car 
or at a remote location within the facility, such as a control room. The 
signaling system must—
(i) Provide a level of surveillance equivalent to that provided in subparagraph 
(1) of this paragraph (i); and

(ii) Provide immediate notification to a designated hazmat employee of any 
system malfunction or other emergency so that, if warranted, responsive actions 
may be initiated immediately.

(j) Attendance is not required when piping is attached to a top outlet of a tank 
car, equipped with a protective housing required under § 179.100-12 of this 
subchapter, for discharge of lading under the following conditions:

(1) All valves are tightly closed.

(2) The piping is not connected to hose or other unloading equipment and is 
fitted with a cap or plug of appropriate material and construction.

(3) The piping extends no more than 15.24 centimeters (6 inches) from the outer 
edge of the protective housing.

(k) In the absence of the unloader, a tank car may stand with unloading 
connections attached when no product is being transferred under the following 
conditions:

(1) The facility operator must designate a hazmat employee responsible for 
on-site monitoring of the transfer facility. The designated hazmat employee must 
be made familiar with the nature and properties of the product contained in the 
tank car; procedures to be followed in the event of an emergency; and, in the 
event of an emergency, have the ability and authority to take responsible 
actions.

(2) When a signaling system is used in accordance with paragraph (i) of this 
section, the system must be capable of alerting the designated hazmat employee 
in the event of an emergency and providing immediate notification of any 
monitoring system malfunction. If the monitoring system does not have 
self-monitoring capability, the designated hazmat employee must check the 
monitoring system hourly for proper operation.

(3) The tank car and facility shutoff valves must be secured in the closed 
position.

(4) Brakes must be set and wheels locked in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of 
this section.

(5) Access to the track must be secured in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of 
this section.

(l) As soon as a tank car is completely unloaded, all valves must be made tight 
by the use of a bar, wrench or other suitable tool, the unloading connections 
must be removed and all other closures made tight.

(m) Railroad defect cards may not be removed.

(n) If oil or gasoline has been spilled on the ground around connections, it 
must be covered with fresh, dry sand or dirt.

(o) All tools and implements used in connection with unloading must be kept free 
of oil, dirt, and grit.

(e) Instructions for using the segregation table for hazardous materials in 
paragraph (d) of this section are as follows:

(1) The absence of any hazard class or division, or a blank space in the table 
indicates that no restrictions apply.

(2) The letter “X” in the table indicates that these materials may not be 
loaded, transported, or stored together in the same rail car or storage facility 
during the course of transportation.

(3) The letter “O” in the table indicates that these materials may not be 
loaded, transported, or stored together in the same rail car or storage facility 
during the course of transportation unless separated in a manner that, in the 
event of leakage from packages under conditions normally incident to 
transportation, commingling of hazardous materials would not occur. 
Notwithstanding the methods of separation employed, Class 8 (corrosive) liquids 
may not be loaded above or adjacent to Class 4 (flammable) or Class 5 
(oxidizing) materials; except that shippers may load carload shipments of such 
materials together when it is known that the mixture of contents would not cause 
a fire or a dangerous evolution of heat or gas.

(4) The “*” in the table indicates that segregation among different Class 1 
(explosive) materials is governed by the compatibility table in paragraph (f) of 
this section.

(5) The note “A” in the second column of the table means that, notwithstanding 
the requirements of the letter “X”, ammonium nitrate fertilizer may be loaded or 
stored with Division 1.1 (explosive) or Division 1.5 materials.

(6) When the § 172.101 table or § 172.402 of this subchapter requires a package 
to bear a subsidiary hazard label, segregation appropriate to the subsidiary 
hazard must be applied when that segregation is more restrictive than that 
required by the primary hazard. However, hazardous materials of the same class 
may be loaded and transported together without regard to segregation required by 
any secondary hazard if the materials are not capable of reacting dangerously 
with each other and causing combustion or dangerous evolution of heat, evolution 
of flammable, poisonous, or asphyxiant gases, or formation of corrosive or 
unstable materials.

(f) Class 1 (explosive) materials may not be loaded, transported, or stored 
together, except as provided in this section, and in accordance with the 
following table:

(g) Instructions for using the compatibility table for Class 1 (explosive) 
materials in paragraph (f) of this section are as follows:

(1) A blank space in the table indicates that no restrictions apply.

(2) The letter “X” in the table indicates that explosives of different 
compatibility groups may not be carried on the same rail car, unless packed in 
separate freight containers (e.g., two or more freight containers mounted upon 
the same rail car).

(3) The numbers in the table mean the following:

(i) “1” means explosives from compatibility group L may only be carried 
on the same rail car with an identical explosive.
(ii) “2” means any combination of explosives from compatibility group C, D, or E 
is assigned to compatibility group E.

(iii) “3” means any combination of explosives from compatibility group C, D, or 
E with those in compatibility group N is assigned to compatibility group D.

(iv) “4” means detonators and detonating primers, Division 1.4S (explosives), 
may not be loaded in the same car with Division 1.1 and 1.2 (explosive) 
materials.

(v) “5” means Division 1.4S fireworks may not be loaded in the same car with 
Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials.

(vi) “6” means explosive articles in compatibility group G, other than fireworks 
and those requiring special stowage, may be loaded and transported with articles 
of compatibility groups C, D and E, provided no explosive substances are carried 
in the same rail car.

(h) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, explosives of the same 
compatibility group but of different divisions may be transported together 
provided that the whole shipment is transported as though its entire contents 
were of the lower numerical division (i.e., Division 1.1 being lower than 
Division 1.2). For example, a mixed shipment of Division 1.2 (explosive) 
materials and Division 1.4 (explosive) materials, compatibility group D, must be 
transported as Division 1.2 (explosive) materials.

(i) When Division 1.5 materials, compatibility group D are transported in the 
same freight container as Division 1.2 (explosive) materials, compatibility 
group D, the shipment must be transported as Division 1.1 (explosive) materials, 
compatibility group D.

[74 FR 1801, Jan. 13, 2009]


Subpart E—Class I (Explosive) Materials


§ 174.101

Loading Class 1 (explosive) materials.

(a) Boxes containing Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials must be loaded so 
that the ends of wooden boxes will not bear against sides of any fiberboard 
boxes and so that the ends of any box will not cause a pressure point on a small 
area of another box.

(b) Explosive bombs, unfuzed projectiles, rocket ammunition and rocket motors, 
Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials, which are not packed in wooden 
boxes, or large metal packages of incendiary bombs, each weighing 226 kg (500 
pounds) or more, may be loaded in stock cars or in flat bottom gondola cars only 
if they are adequately braced. Boxed bombs, rocket ammunition and rocket motors, 
Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials, which due to their size cannot 
be loaded in closed cars, may be loaded in open-top cars or on flatcars, 
provided they are protected from the weather and accidental ignition.

(c) Boxes of Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials packed in long 
cartridges, bags, or sift-proof liners, and containing no liquid explosive 
ingredient, may be loaded on their sides or ends.

(d) Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials may not be loaded higher than any 
permanent car lining unless additional lining is provided as high as the lading.

(e) When the lading of a car includes any Class 1 (explosive) materials, the 
weight of the lading must be distributed insofar as possible to equalize the 
weight on each side of the car and over the trucks.

(f) Except when boxed, metal kegs containing Class 1 (explosive) materials must 
be loaded on their sides with their ends toward the ends of the car. Packages of 
Class 1 (explosive) materials may not be placed in the space opposite the doors 
unless the doorways are boarded on the inside as high as the lading. This 
paragraph does not apply to palletized packages if they are braced so they 
cannot fall or slide into the doorways during transportation.

(g) Wooden kegs, fiber kegs, barrels, and drums must be loaded on their sides or 
ends, to best suit the conditions.

(h) Packages containing any Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials for (see 
§ 174.104), detonators, detonator assemblies, or boosters with detonators must 
be securely blocked and braced to prevent the packages from changing position, 
falling to the floor, or sliding into each other, under conditions normally 
incident to transportation. Class 1 (explosive) materials must be loaded so as 
to avoid transfer at stations. For recommended methods of blocking and bracing, 
see Bureau of Explosives Pamphlets No. 6 and 6A. Heavy packages or containers 
must be trucked, rolled, or moved by skids, fork trucks, or other handling 
devices and may not be dropped from trucks, platforms, or cars. Planks for 
rolling trucks from platforms to cars must have beveled ends. Loading platforms 
and the shoes of each workman must be free from grit. All possible precautions 
must be taken against fire. Class 1 (explosive) materials must be kept in a safe 
place and inaccessible to unauthorized persons while being held by a carrier for 
loading or delivery.

(i) To prevent delays of local freight trains, when there are shipments of Class 
1 (explosive) materials for different destinations loaded in a “peddler car” or 
“way car” the shipment for each destination must be stayed separately.

(j) Forwarding and transfer stations for Class 1 (explosive) materials must be 
provided with the necessary materials for staying.

(k) Shippers must furnish the material for staying packages of Class 1 
(explosive) materials loaded by them.

(l) Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials may not be loaded, transported, or 
stored in a rail car equipped with any type of lighted heater or open-flame 
device, or electric devices having exposed heating coils, or in a rail car 
equipped with any apparatus or mechanism utilizing an internal combustion engine 
in its operation.

(m) [Reserved]

(n) A container car or freight container on a flatcar or a gondola car other 
than a drop-bottom car, when properly loaded, blocked, and braced to prevent 
change of position under conditions normally incident to transportation, may be 
used to transport any Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) material except black 
powder packed in metal containers. A freight container must be designed, 
constructed, and maintained so as to be weather tight and capable of preventing 
the entrance of sparks. In addition:

(1) A freight container must be of such design and so braced as to show no 
evidence of failure of the container or the bracing when subjected to impact 
from each end of at least 13 km (8.1 miles) per hour. Its efficiency shall be 
determined by actual test, using dummy loads equal in weight and general 
character to material to be shipped.

(2) A container car or car which is loaded with freight containers must be 
placarded with the Class 1 (explosive) materials placards as required by subpart 
F of part 172 of this subchapter and with properly executed car certificates as 
required by § 174.104.

(3) Lading must be so loaded, blocked, and braced within the freight container 
that it will not change position under impact from each end of at least 13 km 
(8.1 miles) per hour.

(o) Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials may be loaded and 
transported in a tight closed truck body or 
trailer on a flatcar. Wooden boxed bombs, rocket ammunition, and rocket motors, 
Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials, which due to their size cannot 
be loaded in tight, closed truck bodies or trailers, may be loaded in or on 
open-top truck bodies or trailers. However, they must be protected against 
accidental ignition. In addition:
(1) Each truck body or trailer must meet the requirements of part 177 of this 
subchapter, applicable to shipments of Class 1 (explosive) materials by motor 
vehicle.

(2) Each truck body or trailer must be secured on the rail car so that it will 
not permanently change position or show evidence of failure or impending failure 
of the method of securing the truck body or trailer under impact from each end 
of at least 13 km (8.1 miles) per hour. Its efficiency must be determined by 
actual test, using dummy loads equal in weight and general character to the 
material to be shipped. For recommended methods of blocking and bracing, see the 
Intermodal Loading Guide for Products in Closed Trailers and Containers (IBR, 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter).
(3) Lading must be loaded, blocked, and braced within or on the truck body or 
trailer so that the lading will not change position under impact from each end 
of at least 13 km (8.1 miles) per hour. For recommended methods of blocking and 
bracing, see the Intermodal Loading Guide for Products in Closed Trailers and 
Containers (IBR, 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter).
(4) Each rail car containing Class 1 (explosive) materials and each rail car 
loaded with truck bodies, trailers or containers containing Class 1 (explosive) 
materials must be placarded with Class 1 (explosive) materials placards as 
required by subpart F of part 172 of this subchapter and with properly executed 
car certificates as required by § 174.104.

(5) Each fuel tank of a heater or refrigerating machinery on the truck bodies or 
trailers must be drained and all automatic heating or refrigerating machinery 
must be made inoperative by disconnection of the automatic controls or the 
source of power for their operations.

§ 174.103

Disposition of damaged or astray shipments.

(a) Packages of Class 1 (explosive) materials found damaged or broken in transit 
may be repaired when practicable and not dangerous. A broken box of Division 1.1 
or 1.2 (explosive) materials that cannot be repaired must be reinforced by stout 
wrapping paper and twine, placed in another strong box and surrounded by dry, 
fine sawdust or dry and clean cotton waste or elastic wads made from dry 
newspapers. A ruptured can or keg must be sealed and enclosed in a strong cloth 
bag of good quality and boxed. Damaged packages thus protected and properly 
marked may be forwarded. The box and waybill 
must be marked to indicate that it has been repacked.
(b) Care must be exercised in repacking damaged containers so that no spark is 
produced by contact of metal or other hard surfaces which could ignite loose 
particles of explosive compositions that may be strewn on car floors or freight. 
In addition, the car floors must be thoroughly swept, and washed with a 
plentiful supply of water. Iron-wheel trucks, metal hammers, or other metal 
tools that may produce sparks may not be used. Metal tools must be limited to 
those made of brass, bronze, or copper.

(c) Each package of Class 1 (explosive) materials showing evidence of leakage of 
liquid ingredients must:

(1) Be refused if leakage is discovered before acceptance;

(2) Be disposed of to a person who is competent and willing to remove them from 
the carrier's property, if the leakage is discovered while the shipment is in 
transit; or

(3) Be removed immediately by consignee, if the leakage is discovered at the 
shipment's destination.

(d) When the disposition required by paragraph (c) of this section cannot be 
made, the leaking package must be packed in other boxes large enough to permit 
enclosure and the leaking boxes must be surrounded by at least 5 cm (2 inches)

§ 174.104

Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials; car selection, preparation, 
inspection, and certification.

(a) Except as provided in § 174.101 (b), (n), and (o), Division 1.1 or 1.2 
(explosive) materials being transported by rail may be transported only in a 
certified and properly placarded closed car of not less than 36,300 kg (80,028 
pounds) capacity, with steel underframes and friction draft gear or cushioned 
underframe, except that on a narrow-gauge railroad they may be transported in a 
car of less capacity as long as the car of greatest capacity and strength 
available is used.

(b) Each rail car used for transporting Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) 
materials must meet the following requirements as applicable:

(1) The car must be equipped with air brakes, hand brakes, and roller bearings 
which are in condition for service.

(2) The car may not have any holes or cracks in the roof, sides, ends, or doors 
through which sparks may enter, or unprotected decayed spots which may hold 
sparks and start a fire.

(3) The roof of the car must be carefully inspected from the outside for decayed 
spots, especially under or near the running board, and such spots must be 
covered or repaired to prevent their holding fire from sparks. A car with a roof 
generally decayed, even if tight, may not be used.

(4) The doors must close tightly so that sparks cannot get in at the joints, 
and, if necessary to achieve this degree of tightness, the doors must be 
stripped. The stripping should be placed on the inside and fastened to the door 
frames where it will form a shoulder against which the closed doors are pressed 
by means of wedges or cleats in door shoes or keepers. The openings under the 
doors should be similarly closed. The hasp fastenings must be examined with the 
doors closed and fastened, and the doors must be cleated when necessary to 
prevent them from shifting. When the car is opened for any reason, the wedges or 
cleats must 
be replaced before car containing Class 1 (explosive) materials is permitted to 
proceed.
(5) The roller bearings and the trucks must be carefully examined and put in 
such condition as to reduce to a minimum the danger of hotboxes or other failure 
necessitating the setting out of the car before reaching its destination.

(6) The car must be carefully swept out before it is loaded. For 
less-than-carload shipments the space in which the packages are to be loaded 
must be carefully swept. If evidence of a potential hazardous residue is 
apparent after the floor has been swept, the carrier must either decontaminate 
the car or provide a suitable substitute car.

(7) Any holes in the floor or lining must be repaired and special care taken 
that there are no projecting nails or bolts or exposed pieces of metal which may 
work loose or produce holes in packages of Class 1 (explosive) materials during 
transit. Protruding nails in the floor or lining which have worked loose must be 
drawn, and if necessary for the purpose of fastening the floor or lining, new 
nails must be driven through other parts thereof.

(8) Metal floor plates must be completely covered with wood, plywood, or fiber 
or composition sheets of adequate thickness and strength to prevent contact of 
the floor plates with the packages of Class 1 (explosive) materials under 
conditions incident to transportation, except that the covering of metal floor 
plates is not necessary for carload shipments loaded by the Department of 
Defense provided the Class 1 (explosive) materials are of such nature that they 
are not liable to leakage of dust, powder, or vapor which might become the cause 
of an explosion.

(9) If the car is equipped with automobile loading devices, it may not be used 
unless the loading device is securely attached to the roof of the car with 
fastenings supplementing those already provided and so fixed that it cannot 
fall.

(10) The car must be equipped with high-friction composition brake shoes (except 
metal deck flat cars used for COFC/TOFC service may be equipped with high 
phosphorus cast iron brakeshoes) and brake rigging designed for this type of 
brake shoe. Each brake shoe on the car must be at least 1 cm (0.4 inch) thick, 
and in safe and suitable condition for service.

(11) The car must have either a metal subfloor with no combustible material 
exposed beneath the car, or metal spark shields extending from center sill to 
side sills and from end sills to at least 30 cm (12 inches) beyond the extreme 
treads of the inside wheels of each truck, which are tightly fitted against the 
subfloor so that there is no vacant space or combustible material exposed. The 
metal subfloor or spark shields may not have an accumulation of oil, grease, or 
other debris which could support combustion.

(c) Before Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials may be loaded into a rail 
car, the car must have been inspected and certified to be in compliance with the 
requirements of paragraph (b) of this section by a qualified person designated 
under § 215.11 of this title. The certification shall be made in Car Certificate 
No. 1 on the form prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section.

(d) If the carrier furnishes the car to a shipper for loading Division 1.1 or 
1.2 (explosive) materials, the shipper or his authorized employee shall, before 
commencing the loading of the car, inspect the interior thereof, and after 
loading certify to the proper condition of the car and the loading. This 
certification shall be made on the first signature line in Car Certificate No. 2 
on the form prescribed in paragraph (f) of this section. In addition, the 
finished load must be inspected and certified to be in compliance with the 
requirements of this part by a qualified person designated under § 215.11 of 
this title before the car goes forward. This certification shall be made on the 
second signature line in Car Certificate No. 2 on the form prescribed in 
paragraph (f) of this section. If the loading is performed by the carrier, Car 
Certificate No. 2 may only be signed by a qualified person designated under 
§ 215.11 of this title.

(e) If a trailer or container containing Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) 
materials is loaded on a flatcar, the loading and securing of the load on the 
car must be supervised by a representative of the shipper or carrier. The 
certification shall be made in Car Certificate No. 3 on the form prescribed in 
paragraph (f) of this section.
(f) Each car certificate for use in connection with the inspection of rail cars 
for the carriage of Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials shall be printed 
on strong tag board measuring 18 by 18 cm (7.1 by 7.1 inches) or 15 by 20 cm 
(5.9 by 7.9 inches). It must be duly executed in triplicate by the carrier, and 
by the shipper if he loads the shipments. The original must be filed by the 
carrier at the forwarding station in a separate file and the other two must be 
attached to the car, one to each outer side on a fixed placard board or as 
otherwise provided.

(a) General. The provisions of this section apply only to materials extremely 
poisonous by inhalation which are Division 2.3 materials in Hazard Zone A and 
Division 6.1 materials in Hazard Zone A, as defined in § 173.133(a)(2) of this 
subchapter. Such materials when shipped by, for, or to the Department of Defense 
may be transported by rail only if loaded and handled in accordance with the 
requirements of this section.

(b) A Division 2.3 Hazard Zone A or a Division 6.1 Hazard Zone A material 
extremely poisonous by inhalation may be transported in:

(1) UN 1N1 or UN 1N2 metal drums or equivalent military specification metal 
drums, by boxcar, gondola car (flat bottom), or stock car in carload lots. See 
§§ 174.55 and 174.600 for blocking, bracing, and stowage requirements;

(2) Tanks which are authorized under this subchapter for a Hazard Zone A 
material extremely poisonous by inhalation, Specification DOT 106A (§§ 179.300 
and 179.301 of this subchapter), mounted on or secured to a multi-unit car or 
gondola car (flat bottom) in carload lots only;

(3) Bombs, by boxcar, or gondola car (flat bottom) in carload lots only; or

(4) Projectiles or ammunition for cannon with gas filled projectiles, by boxcar 
in carload or less-than-carload lots.

(c) Each shipment of one or more carloads of a material extremely poisonous by 
inhalation, as described in paragraph (b) of this section, must be accompanied 
by a Department of Defense qualified escort supplied with equipment to handle 
leaks and other packaging failures which could result in escape of the material. 
The escort shall remain with the shipment during 
the entire time that it is in the custody of the carrier and in the event of 
leakage or escape of material, shall make repairs and perform decontamination as 
necessary.
(d) When a material extremely poisonous by inhalation is transported in a tank, 
the tank must be securely mounted on a rail car especially provided for it or on 
a gondola car prepared with substantial wooden frames and blocks.

(e) Bombs, projectiles, and cannon ammunition being transported by rail must be 
loaded, blocked and braced as shown in Bureau of Explosives Pamphlet No. 6A, or 
Department of Defense specifications. When a shipment is loaded in a gondola car 
it must be securely blocked and braced and not loaded higher than the sides of 
the car.

(f) When a material extremely poisonous by inhalation is transported in drums 
with filling holes in the heads, they must be loaded on their bottoms. They may 
be loaded in rows, lengthwise of the car and any space between the sides of the 
car and the nearest row of drums must be “filled in” with wooden boards or 
lumber nailed to sides of the car sufficient in length and width to contact both 
hoops of drums, or they may be loaded across the car in staggered stacks of 
which the number of drums in alternate stacks is reduced by one drum. All drums 
in stacks following the first stack loaded in the end of the car must be placed 
tightly into the angle of the space formed by the sidewalls of the drum in the

(1) Retain a copy of the shipping paper required by § 175.30(a)(2) or an 
electronic image thereof, that is accessible at or through its principal place 
of business and must make the shipping paper available, upon request, to an 
authorized official of a federal, state, or local government agency at 
reasonable times and locations. For a hazardous waste, each shipping paper copy 
must be retained for three years after the material is accepted by the initial 
carrier. For all other hazardous materials, each shipping paper copy must be 
retained by the operator for one year after the material is accepted by the 
initial carrier. Each shipping paper copy must include the date of acceptance by 
the carrier. The date on the shipping paper may be the date a shipper notifies 
the air carrier that a shipment is ready for transportation, as indicated on the 
air bill or bill of lading, as an alternative to the date the shipment is picked 
up or accepted by the carrier. Only an initial carrier must receive and retain a 
copy of the shipper's certification, as required by § 172.204 of this 
subchapter.

(2) Retain a copy of each notification of pilot-in-command, an electronic image 
thereof, or the information contained therein for 90 days at the airport of 
departure or the operator's principal place of business.

where a crew member or other authorized person can access, handle, and, when 
size and weight permit, separate such packages from other cargo during flight, 
including a freight container in an accessible cargo compartment when packages 
are loaded in an accessible manner. Additionally, a package is considered 
accessible when transported on a cargo-only aircraft if it is:
(i) In a cargo compartment certified by FAA as a Class C aircraft cargo 
compartment as defined in 14 CFR 25.857(c); or

(ii) In an FAA-certified freight container that has an approved fire or smoke 
detection system and fire suppression system equivalent to that required by the 
certification requirements for a Class C aircraft cargo compartment.

(2) 
Inaccessible
means all other configurations to include packages loaded where a crew member or 
other authorized person cannot access, handle, and, when size and weight permit, 
separate such packages from other cargo during flight, including a freight 
container in an accessible cargo compartment when packages are loaded in an 
inaccessible manner.

(1) Hazard labels, classes or divisions not shown in the table are not subject 
to segregation requirements.

(2) Dots at the intersection of a row and column indicate that no restrictions 
apply.

(3) The letter “X” at the intersection of a row and column indicates that 
packages containing these classes of hazardous materials may not be stowed next 
to or in contact with each other, or in a position which would allow interaction 
in the event of leakage of the contents.

(4) Note 1. “Note 1” at the intersection of a row and column means the 
following:

(i) Only Division 1.4, Compatibility Group S, explosives are permitted to be 
transported aboard a passenger aircraft. Only certain Division 1.3, 
Compatibility Groups C and G, and Division 1.4, Compatibility Groups B, C, D, E, 
G and S, explosives may be transported aboard a cargo aircraft.

(ii) Division 1.4 explosives in Compatibility Group S may be stowed with 
Division 1.3 and 1.4 explosives in compatibility groups as permitted aboard 
aircraft under paragraph (c)(4)(i) above.

(iii) Except for Division 1.4B explosives and as otherwise provided in this 
Note, explosives of different compatibility groups may be stowed together 
whether or not they belong to the same division. Division 1.4B explosives must 
not be stowed together with any other explosive permitted aboard aircraft except 
Division 1.4S, unless segregated as prescribed in paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this 
section (“Note 1”).

(iv) Division 1.4B and Division 1.3 explosives may not be stowed together. 
Division 1.4B explosives must be loaded into separate unit load devices and, 
when stowed aboard the aircraft, the unit load devices must be separated by 
other cargo with a minimum separation of 2 m (6.5 feet). When not loaded in unit 
load devices, Division 1.4B and Division 1.3 explosives must be loaded into 
different, non-adjacent loading positions and separated by other cargo with a 
minimum separation of 2 m (6.5 feet).

(5) Note 2. “Note 2” at the intersection of a row and column means that other 
than explosives of Division 1.4, Compatibility Group S, explosives may not be 
stowed together with that class.

(6) Packages containing hazardous materials with multiple hazards in the class 
or divisions, which require segregation in accordance with the Segregation 
Table, need not be segregated from other packages bearing the same UN number.

(7) A package labeled “BLASTING AGENT” may not be stowed next to or in a 
position that will allow contact with a package of special fireworks or railway 
torpedoes.

§ 175.90

Damaged shipments.

(a) Packages or overpacks containing hazardous materials must be inspected for 
damage or leakage after being unloaded from an aircraft. When packages or 
overpacks containing hazardous materials have been transported 
in a unit load device, the area where the unit load device was stowed must be 
inspected for evidence of leakage or contamination immediately upon removal of 
the unit load device from the aircraft, and the packages or overpacks must be 
inspected for evidence of damage or leakage when the unit load device is 
unloaded. In the event of leakage or suspected leakage, the compartment in which 
the package, overpack, or unit load device was carried must be inspected for 
contamination and decontaminated, if applicable.
(b) Except as provided in § 175.700, the operator of an aircraft must remove 
from the aircraft any package, baggage or cargo that appears to be leaking or 
contaminated by a hazardous material. In the case of a package, baggage or cargo 
that appears to be leaking, the operator must ensure that other packages, 
baggage or cargo in the same shipment are in proper condition for transport 
aboard the aircraft and that no other package, baggage or cargo has been 
contaminated or is leaking. If an operator becomes aware that a package, baggage 
or cargo not identified as containing a hazardous material has been 
contaminated, or the operator has cause to believe that a hazardous material may 
be the cause of the contamination, the operator must take reasonable steps to 
identify the nature and source of contamination before proceeding with the 
loading of the contaminated baggage or cargo. If the contaminating substance is 
found or suspected to be hazardous material, the operator must isolate the 
package, baggage or cargo and take appropriate steps to eliminate any identified 
hazard before continuing the transportation of the item by aircraft.

(c) No person may place aboard an aircraft a package, baggage or cargo that is 
contaminated with a hazardous material or appears to be leaking.

(d) If a package containing a material in Division 6.2 (infectious substance) is 
found to be damaged or leaking, the person finding the package must:

(1) Avoid handling the package or keep handling to a minimum;

(2) Inspect packages adjacent to the leaking package for contamination and 
withhold from further transportation any contaminated packages until it is 
ascertained that they can be safely transported;

(3) Comply with the reporting requirement of §§ 171.15 and 175.31 of this 
subchapter; and

(4) Notify the consignor or consignee.

may be carried on certain passenger and cargo aircraft as provided in this 
section, without regard to the packaging references and quantity limits listed 
in Columns 7, 8 and 9 of the § 172.101 Hazardous Materials Table. All 
requirements of this subchapter that are not specifically covered in this 
section continue to apply to shipments made under the provisions of this 
section. For purposes of this section “impracticable” means transportation is 
not physically possible or cannot be performed by routine and frequent means of 
other transportation, due to extenuating circumstances. Extenuating 
circumstances include: conditions precluding highway or water transportation, 
such as a frozen vessel route; road closures due to catastrophic weather or 
volcanic activity; or a declared state of emergency. The desire for expedience 
of a shipper, carrier, or consignor, is not relevant in determining whether 
other means of transportation are impracticable. The stowage requirements of 
§ 175.75(a) do not apply to a person operating an aircraft under the provisions 
of this section which, because of its size and configuration, makes it 
impossible to comply.

(b) A small passenger-carrying aircraft operated entirely within the State of 
Alaska or into a remote area, in other than scheduled passenger operations, may 
carry up to 76 L (20 gallons) of flammable liquid fuel (in Packing Group II or 
Packing Group III), when:

(1) The flight is necessary to meet the needs of a passenger; and

(2) The fuel is carried in one of the following types of containers:

(i) Strong tight metal containers of not more than 20 L (5.3 gallons) capacity, 
each packed inside a UN 4G fiberboard box, at the Packing Group II performance 
level, or each packed inside a UN 4C1 wooden box, at the Packing Group II 
performance level;

(ii) Airtight, leakproof, inside containers of not more than 40 L (11 gallons) 
capacity and of at least 28-gauge metal, each packed inside a UN 4C1 wooden box, 
at the Packing Group II performance level;

(iii) UN 1A1 steel drums, at the Packing Group I or II performance level, of not 
more than 20 L (5.3 gallons) capacity; or

(iv) In fuel tanks attached to flammable liquid fuel powered equipment under the 
following conditions:

(A) Each piece of equipment is secured in an upright position;

(B) Each fuel tank is filled in a manner that will preclude spillage of fuel 
during loading, unloading, and transportation; and

(C) Fueling and refueling of the equipment is prohibited in or on the aircraft.

(3) In the case of a passenger-carrying helicopter, the fuel or fueled equipment 
must be carried on external cargo racks or slings.

(c) Flammable liquid fuels may be carried on a cargo aircraft, subject to the 
following conditions:

(1)(i) The flammable liquid fuel is in Packing Group II or Packing Group III 
except as indicated in paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section;

(ii) The fuel is carried in packagings authorized in paragraph (b) of this 
section;

(iii) The fuel is carried in metal drums (UN 1A1, 1B1, 1N1) authorized for 
Packing Group I or Packing Group II liquid hazardous materials and having rated 
capacities of 220 L (58 gallons) or less. These single packagings may not be 
transported in the same aircraft with Class 1, Class 5, or Class 8 materials.

(iv) Combustible and flammable liquid fuels (including those in Packing Group I) 
may be carried in installed aircraft tanks each having a capacity of more than 
450 L (118.9 gallons), subject to the following additional conditions:

§ 175.630

Special requirements for Division 6.1 (poisonous) material and Division 6.2 
(infectious substances) materials.

(a) [Reserved]

(b) No person may operate an aircraft that has been used to transport any 
package required to bear a POISON or POISON INHALATION HAZARD label unless, upon 
removal of such package, the area in the aircraft in which it was carried is 
visually inspected for evidence of leakage, spillage, or other contamination. 
All contamination discovered must be either isolated or removed from the 
aircraft. The operation of an aircraft contaminated with such Division 6.1 
materials is considered to be the carriage of poisonous materials under 
paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) When unloaded from the aircraft, each package, overpack, pallet, or unit 
load device containing a Division 6.2 material must be inspected for signs of 
leakage. If evidence of leakage is found, the cargo compartment in which the 
package, overpack, or unit load device was transported must be disinfected. 
Disinfection may be by any means that will make the material released 
ineffective at transmitting disease.

measuring the shortest distance between the surfaces of the Class 7 
(radioactive) materials package and the surfaces bounding the space occupied by 
passengers or animals. If more than one package of Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials is placed in a passenger-carrying aircraft, the minimum separation 
distance for these packages shall be determined in accordance with paragraphs 
(a) and (b) of this section on the basis of the sum of the transport index 
numbers of the individual packages or overpacks.

(d) 
Predesignated areas.
A package labeled RADIOACTIVE YELLOW-II or RADIOACTIVE YELLOW-III may be carried 
in a passenger-carrying aircraft in accordance with a system of predesignated 
areas established by the aircraft operator. Each aircraft operator that elects 
to use a system of predesignated areas shall submit a detailed description of 
the proposed system to the Associate Administrator for approval prior to 
implementation of the system. A proposed system of predesignated areas is 
approved if the Associate Administrator determines that it is designed to assure 
that:
(1) The packages can be placed in each predesignated area in accordance with the 
minimum separation distances prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section; and

(2) The predesignated areas are separated from each other by minimum distance 
equal to at least four times the distances required by paragraphs (a) and (b) of

Handling requirements for carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice).

Carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice) when shipped by itself or when used as a 
refrigerant for other commodities, may be carried only if the operator has made 
suitable arrangements based on the aircraft type, the aircraft ventilation 
rates, the method of packing and stowing, whether animals will be carried on the 
same flight and other factors. The operator must ensure that the ground staff is 
informed that the dry ice is being loaded or is on board the aircraft. For 
arrangements between the shipper and operator, see § 173.217 of this subchapter. 
Where dry ice is contained in a unit load device (ULD) or other type of pallet 
prepared by a single shipper in accordance with § 173.217 and the operator after 
the acceptance adds additional dry ice, the operator must ensure that the 
information provided to the Pilot-in-Command and the marking on the ULD when 
used as a packaging reflects that revised quantity of dry ice.

element gas container (MEGC). A 
closed cargo transport unit
means a cargo transport unit in which the contents are totally enclosed by 
permanent structures. An 
open cargo transport unit
means a cargo transport unit that is not a closed cargo transport unit. Cargo 
transport units with fabric sides or tops are not closed cargo transport units 
for the purposes of this part.

Clear of living quarters
means that the hazardous material must be located so that in the event of 
release of the material, leakage or vapors will not penetrate accommodations, 
machinery spaces or other work areas by means of entrances or other openings in 
bulkheads or ventilation ducts.

Closed freight container
means a freight container which totally encloses its contents by permanent 
structures. A freight container formed partly by a tarpaulin, plastic sheet, or 
similar material is not a closed freight container.

Closed cargo transport unit for Class 1 (explosive) materials
means a freight container or transport vehicle that fully encloses the contents 
by permanent structures and can be secured to the ship's structure and are, 
except for the carriage of division 1.4 explosives, structurally serviceable 
(see § 176.172). Portable magazines conforming to § 176.137 are also considered 
closed cargo transport units for Class 1. Small compartments such as deck houses 
and mast lockers are included. Cargo transport units with fabric sides or tops 
are not closed cargo transport units. The floor of any closed cargo transport 
unit must either be constructed of wood, close-boarded or so arranged that goods

and at such a speed as to cause damage to its surroundings. Individual explosive 
substances are identified in column 17 of the Dangerous Goods List in the IMDG 
Code.

Handling
means the operation of loading and unloading a vessel; transfer to, from, or 
within a vessel, and any ancillary operations.

Hold
means a compartment below deck that is used exclusively for the carriage of 
cargo.

In containers or the like
means any clean, substantial, weatherproof box structure which can be secured to 
the vessel's structure, including a portable magazine or a closed cargo 
transport unit. Whenever this stowage is specified, stowage in deckhouses, mast 
lockers and oversized weatherproof packages (overpacks) is also acceptable.

Incompatible materials
means two materials whose stowage together may result in undue hazards in the 
case of leakage, spillage, or other accident.

INF cargo
means packaged irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium or high-level radioactive 
wastes as those terms are defined in the “International Code for the Safe 
Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level 
Radioactive Wastes on Board Ships” (INF Code) contained in the IMDG Code.

where such machinery has in the aggregate a total power output of not less than 
375 kw; or

(3) any oil-fired boiler or fuel unit.


Magazine
means an enclosure designed to protect certain goods of Class 1 (explosive) 
materials from damage by other cargo and adverse weather conditions during 
loading, unloading, and when in transit; and to prevent unauthorized access. A 
magazine may be a fixed structure or compartment in the vessel, a closed freight 
container, a closed transport vehicle, or a portable magazine. Magazines may be 
positioned in any part of the ship conforming with the relevant provisions for 
Class 1 (explosive) materials contained in Subpart G of this part provided that 
magazines which are fixed structures are sited so that their doors, where 
fitted, are easily accessible.

Master of the Vessel,
as used in this part, includes the person in charge of an unmanned vessel or 
barge.

Open freight container
means a freight container that does not totally enclose its contents by 
permanent structures.

Overstowed
means a package or container is stowed directly on top of another. However, with 
regard to Class 1 (explosive) stowage, such goods may themselves be stacked to a 
safe level but other goods should not be stowed directly on top of them.

Pallet
means a portable platform for stowing, handling, and moving cargo.


Palletized unit
means packages or unpackaged objects stacked on a pallet, banded and secured to 
the pallet by metal, fabric, or plastic straps for the purpose of handling as a 
single unit.

means, but is not limited to, open fires, machinery exhausts, galley uptakes, 
electrical outlets and electrical equipment including those on refrigerated or 
heated cargo transport units unless they are of a type designed to operate in a 
hazardous environment.

Protected from sources of heat
means that packages and cargo transport units must be stowed at least 2.4 m from 
heated ship structures, where the surface temperature is liable to exceed 131 °F 
(55 °C). Examples of heated structures are steam pipes, heating coils, top or 
side walls of heated fuel and cargo tanks, and bulkheads of machinery spaces. In 
addition, packages not loaded inside a cargo transport unit and stowed on deck 
must be shaded from direct sunlight. The surface of a cargo transport unit can 
heat rapidly when in direct sunlight in nearly windless conditions and the cargo 
may also become heated. Depending on the nature of the goods in the cargo 
transport unit, and the planned voyage, precautions must be taken to ensure that 
exposure to direct sunlight is reduced.

Readily combustible material
means a material which may or may not be classed as a hazardous material but 
which is easily ignited and supports combustion. Examples of readily combustible 
materials include wood, paper, straw, vegetable fibers, products made from such 
materials, coal, lubricants, and oils. This definition does not apply to 
packaging material or dunnage.

Responsible person
means a person empowered by the master of the vessel to make all decisions 
relating to his or her specific task, and having the necessary knowledge and 
experience for that purpose.

§ 176.39

Inspection of cargo.

(a) 
Manned vessels.
The carrier, its agents, and any person designated for this purpose by the 
carrier or agents shall cause an inspection of each hold or compartment 
containing hazardous materials to be made after stowage is complete, and at 
least once every 24 hours thereafter, weather permitting, in order to ensure 
that the cargo is in a safe condition and that no damage caused by shifting, 
spontaneous heating, leaking, sifting, wetting, or other cause has been 
sustained by the vessel or its cargo since loading and stowage. However, freight 
containers or individual barges need not be opened. A vessel's holds equipped 
with smoke or fire detecting systems having an automatic monitoring capability 
need not be inspected except after stowage is complete and after periods of 
heavy weather. The carrier, its agents, and any person designated for this 
purpose by the carrier or agents shall cause an entry to be made in the vessel's 
deck log book for each inspection of the stowage of hazardous materials 
performed.
(b) 
Unmanned and magazine vessels.
An inspection of the cargo must be made after stowage has been completed to 
ensure that stowage has been accomplished properly and that there are no visible 
signs of damage to any packages or evidence of heating, leaking, or sifting.

the direction and observation of a responsible person assigned this duty.

(b) For a vessel engaged in coastwise voyages, or on rivers, bays, sounds or 
lakes, including the Great Lakes when the voyage is not foreign-going, the 
responsible person may be an employee of the carrier and assigned this duty by 
the carrier, or a licensed officer attached to the vessel and assigned by the 
master of the vessel.

(c) For a domestic vessel engaged in a foreign-going or intercoastal voyage, the 
responsible person must be an officer possessing an unexpired license issued by 
the USCG and assigned this duty by the master of the vessel.

(d) For a foreign vessel, the responsible person must be an officer of the

Bilges must be examined and all residue of previous cargo removed.
(b) All decks, gangways, hatches, and cargo ports over or through which 
hazardous materials must be passed or handled in loading or unloading must be 
free of all loose materials before cargo handling operations begin.

(c) No debris that creates a fire hazard or a hazardous condition for persons 
engaged in handling hazardous materials may be on the weather deck of a vessel 
during loading or unloading operations.

(d) Hatch beams and hatch covers may not be stowed in a location that would 
interfere with cargo handling.

[Amdt. 176-30, 55 FR 52689, Dec. 21, 1990]


§ 176.60

“No Smoking” signs.

When smoking is prohibited during the loading, stowing, storing, transportation, 
or unloading of hazardous materials by this part, the carrier and the master of 
the vessel are jointly responsible for posting “NO SMOKING” signs in conspicuous 
locations.


§ 176.63

Stowage locations.

(a) The table in § 172.101 of this subchapter specifies generally the locations 
authorized for stowage of the various hazardous materials on board vessels. This 
part prescribes additional requirements with respect to the stowage of specific 
hazardous materials in addition to those authorized in § 172.101 of this 
subchapter. This section sets forth the basic physical requirements for the 
authorized locations. Hazardous materials offered for transport as limited 
quantities are allocated stowage category A and are not subject to any of the 
specific stowage requirements indicated in column 10B in § 172.101 of this 
subchapter for the material being transported.

(b) To qualify as “on deck” stowage, the location must be on the weather deck. 
If the location is in a house on the weather deck, the location must have a 
permanent structural opening to the atmosphere, such as a door, hatch, 
companionway or manhole, and must be vented to the atmosphere. The location may 
not have any structural opening to any living quarters, cargo, or other 
compartment unless the opening has means for being closed off and secured. Any 
deck house containing living quarters, a steering engine, a refrigerating unit, 
a refrigerated stowage box, or a heating unit may not be used unless that area 
is isolated from the cargo stowage area by a permanent, and tight, metallic 
bulkhead. Stowage in a shelter or 'tween deck is not considered to be “on deck”. 
A barge that is vented to the atmosphere and is stowed on deck on a 
barge-carrying ship is considered to be “on deck”. When an entry in § 172.101 of 
this subchapter requires “on-deck” stowage and is qualified by the requirement 
“protected from sources of heat”, the stowage must be protected from the direct 
rays of the sun by means of structural erections or awnings except that such 
protection is not required for shipment in portable tanks.

(c) To qualify as “under deck” stowage, the location must be in a hold or 
compartment below the weather deck capable of being ventilated and allotted 
entirely to the carriage of cargo. It must be bounded by permanent steel decks 
and bulkheads or the shell of the vessel. The deck openings must have means for 
effectively closing the hold or compartment against the weather, and in the case 
of superimposed holds, for effectively closing off each hold. A hold or 
compartment containing a crew passage formed by battens or by mesh or wire 
screen bulkhead may not be used for the stowage of any hazardous material unless 
a watchman is provided for this area.

(d) To qualify as “under deck away from heat”, the location must be under deck 
and have built-in means for ventilation. If it is subject to heat from any 
artificial source, it only qualifies for the stowage of those hazardous 
materials for which “under deck” stowage is authorized.

(e) Notwithstanding the stowage provisions given in the table in § 172.101 of 
this subchapter, empty packages containing residue, including IBCs and large 
packages, may be stowed “on deck” or “under deck” in a mechanically ventilated 
cargo space. However, empty pressure receptacles containing residue that carry a 
label of class 2.3 must be stowed “on deck” and waste 
aerosols must be stowed in accordance with the table in § 172.101 of this 
subchapter.
(f) 
Stowage of containers on board hatchless container ships.
(1) Containers holding a hazardous material may be stowed in or vertically above 
a hatchless container hold if the following conditions are met:
(1) All hazardous materials are permitted for 
under deck
stowage as specified in the Table in § 172.101 of this subchapter; and
(2) The hatchless container hold is in full compliance with the provisions of 
SOLAS, Chapter II-2/Regulation 19 (IBR; 
see
§ 171.7 of this subchapter), applicable to enclosed container cargo spaces, as 
appropriate for the cargo transported.

Alternative stowage procedures.

When a hazardous material is to be loaded on board a vessel and it is shown to 
the satisfaction of the Coast Guard Captain of the Port for the place where the 
vessel is being loaded that it is impracticable to comply with a stowage 
location requirement specified in the § 172.101 table of this subchapter or a 
segregation, handling or stowage requirement specified in this part, the Captain 
of the Port may authorize in writing the use of an alternative stowage location 
or method of segregation, handling or stowage subject to such conditions as he 
finds will insure a level of safety at least equal to that afforded by the 
regulatory requirement concerned.

must be stowed as to remain in the position indicated during transportation.

(c) If a vessel designed for and carrying hazardous materials in freight 
containers or a vessel designed for and carrying hazardous materials in barges 
is equipped with a fixed fire extinguishing and fire detection system, the 
freight containers or barges need not be stowed in the manner required by 
paragraph (a) of this section. When freight containers or barges containing 
hazardous materials are stowed on deck, they need not be stowed in the manner 
required by paragraph (a) of this section if fire fighting equipment capable of 
reaching and piercing the freight container or barge is on board the vessel.

(d) Packages of hazardous materials must be secured and dunnaged to prevent 
shifting in any direction. Vertical restraints are not required if the shape of 
the package and the stuffing pattern preclude shifting of the load.

(e) Packages of hazardous materials must be braced and dunnaged so that they are 
not likely to be pierced by the dunnage or crushed by a superimposed load.

pressure in the package, must be contained in a steel jacketed Specification 
MC-338 (§ 178.338 of this subchapter) insulated cargo tank.

(2) Any valve or fitting with moving or abrading parts that may come in contact 
with any cryogenic liquid may not be made of aluminum.

(3) For a flammable cryogenic liquid being transported in a cargo tank, the 
elapsed time between the loading of the cargo tank and the subsequent unloading 
of the cargo tank at its final destination may not exceed the marked rated 
holding time (MRHT) of the cargo tank for the cryogenic liquid being 
transported, which must be displayed on or adjacent to the specification plate.

(4) Portable tanks, cargo tanks, and tank cars containing cryogenic liquids 
must be stowed “on deck” regardless of the stowage authorized in § 172.101 of 
this subchapter. Cargo tanks or tank cars containing cryogenic liquids may be 
stowed one deck below the weather deck when transported on a trailership or 
trainship that is unable to provide “on deck” stowage because of the vessel's 
design. Tank cars must be Class DOT-113 or AAR-204W tank cars.
(h) A fumigated cargo transport unit may only be transported on board a vessel 
subject to the following conditions and limitations:

(1) The fumigated cargo transport unit may be placed on board a vessel only if 
at least 24 hours have elapsed since the unit was last fumigated;

(2) The fumigated cargo transport unit is accompanied by a document showing the 
date of fumigation and the type and amount of fumigant used;

(3) Prior to loading, the master is informed of the intended placement of the 
fumigated cargo transport unit on board the vessel and the information provided 
on the accompanying document;

(a) 
Power Operated trucks.
A power-operated truck (including a power-operated tractor, forklift, or other 
specialized truck used for cargo handling) may not be used on board a vessel in 
a space containing a hazardous material unless the truck conforms to the 
requirements of this section. The COTP may suspend or prohibit the use of cargo 
handling vehicles or equipment when that use constitutes a safety hazard.
(b) Each truck must have a specific designation of Underwriter's Laboratories or 
Factory Mutual Laboratories. Any repair or alteration to a truck must be 
equivalent to that required on the original designation.

(c) 
Description of designations.
The recognized testing laboratory type designations are as follows:
(1) An “E” designated unit is an electrically-powered unit that has minimum 
acceptable safeguards against inherent fire hazards.

(2) An “EE” designated unit is an electrically-powered unit that has, in 
addition to all the requirements for the “E” unit, the electric motor and all 
other electrical equipment completely enclosed.

(3) An “EX” designated unit is an electrically-powered unit that differs from 
the “E” and “EE” unit in that the electrical fittings and equipment 
are so designed, constructed, and assembled that the unit may be used in certain 
atmospheres containing flammable vapors or dusts.
(4) A “G” designated unit is a gasoline-powered unit having minimum acceptable 
safeguards against inherent fire hazards.

(5) A “GS” designated unit is a gasoline-powered unit that is provided with 
additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical systems.

(6) An “LP” designated unit is similar to a “G” unit except that it is powered 
by liquefied petroleum gas instead of gasoline.

(7) An “LPS” designated unit is a unit similar to a “GS” unit except that 
liquefied petroleum gas is used for fuel instead of gasoline.

(8) A “D” designated unit is a unit similar to a “G” unit except that it is 
powered by a diesel engine instead of a gasoline engine.

(9) A “DS” designated unit is a unit powered by a diesel engine provided with 
additional safeguards to the exhaust, fuel, and electrical systems.

(d) 
Class 1 (explosive) materials.

other cargo in an area near Class 1 (explosive) materials on board a vessel 
except:
(1) A power-operated truck designated EE or EX.

(2) A power-operated truck designated LPS, GS, D, or DS may be used under 
conditions acceptable to the COTP.

(e) 
Other hazardous materials.
(1) Only an “EX”, “EE”, “GS”, “LPA”, or “DS” truck may be used in a hold or 
compartment containing Division 2.1 (flammable gas) materials, Class 3 
(flammable liquids), Class 4 (flammable solids) materials, or Class 5 (oxidizers 
or organic peroxides) materials, cottons or other vegetable fibers, or bulk 
sulfur.
(2) Only a designated truck may be used to handle any other hazardous material 
not covered in paragraph (d) or (e)(1) of this section.

(f) 
Minimum safety features.
In addition to the construction and design safety features required, each truck 
must have at least the following minimum safety features:
(1) The truck must be equipped with a warning horn, whistle, gong, or other 
device that may be heard clearly above normal shipboard noises.

(2) When the truck operation may expose the operator to danger from a falling 
object, the truck must be equipped with a driver's overhead guard. When the 
overall height of the truck with forks in the lowered position is limited by 
head room the overhead guard may be omitted. This overhead guard is only 
intended to offer protection from impact of small packages, boxes, bagged 
material, or similar hazards.

(3) A forklift truck used to handle small objects or unstable loads must be 
equipped with a load backrest extension having height, width, and strength 
sufficient to prevent any load, or part of it, from falling toward the mast when 
the mast is in a position of maximum backward tilt. The load backrest extension 
must be constructed in a manner that does not interfere with good visibility.

(4) The forks on a fork lift truck must be secured to the carriage so as to 
prevent any unintentional lifting of the toe which could create a hazard. The 
forks may not display permanent deformation when subjected to a test load of 
three times the rated capacity.

(5) Each fork extension or other attachment must be secured to prevent 
unintentional lifting or displacement on primary forks.

(6) Tires extending beyond the confines of the truck shall be provided with a 
guard to prevent the tires from throwing particles at the operator.

(7) Unless the steering mechanism is a type that prevents road reactions from 
causing the steering handwheel to spin, a mushroom type steering knob must be 
used to engage the palm of the operator's hand, or the steering mechanism must 
be arranged in some other manner to prevent injury. The knob must be mounted 
within the perimeter of the wheel.

(8) All steering controls must be confined within the clearnace of the truck or 
guarded so that moving of the controls will not result in injury to the operator 
when passing stanchions, obstructions or other.

(g) 
Special operating conditions.
(1) A truck may not be used on board a vessel unless prior notification of its 
use is given to the master or senior deck officer on board.
(2) Before a truck is operated on board a vessel, it must be in a safe operating 
condition as determined by the master or senior deck officer on board.

(3) Any truck that emits sparks or flames from the exhaust system must 
immediately be removed from service and may not be returned to service until the 
cause of these sparks or flames has been eliminated.

(4)-(5) [Reserved]

(6) All truck motors must be shut off immediately when a breakage or leakage of 
packages containing flammable liquids or gases, flammable solids, oxidizers, or 
organic peroxides occurs or is discovered.

(7) The rated capacity of the truck must be posted on the truck at all times in 
a conspicuous place. This capacity may not be exceeded.

(8) At least one Coast Guard approved marine type size 1 Type B, or UL approved 
5BC portable fire extinguisher, or its approved equivalent, must be affixed to 
the truck in a readily accessible position or must be kept in close proximity, 
available for immediate use.

(9) The vessel's fire fighting equipment, both fixed (where installed) and 
portable, must be kept ready for immediate use in the vicinity of the space 
being worked.

(h) 
Refueling.
(1) A truck using gasoline as fuel may not be refueled in the hold or on the 
weather deck of a vessel unless a portable non-spilling fuel handling system of 
not over five gallons capacity is used. Gasoline may not be transferred to a 
portable non-spilling fuel handling device on board the vessel.
(2) A truck using liquefied petroleum gas as fuel may not be refueled in the 
hold or on the weather deck of a vessel unless it is fitted with a removable 
tank and the hand-operated shutoff valve of the depleted tank is closed. In 
addition, the motor must be run until it stalls from lack of fuel and then the 
hand-operated shut off valve closed before the quick disconnect fitting to the 
fuel tank is disconnected.

(3) A truck using diesel oil as fuel may not be refueled on the weather deck or 
in the hold of a vessel unless a portable container of not over a five gallon 
capacity is used. A truck may be refueled or a portable container may be 
refilled from a larger container of diesel fuel on the weather deck of a vessel 
if a suitable pump is used for the transfer operation and a drip pan of adequate 
size is used to prevent any dripping of fuel on the deck.

(4) Refueling must be performed under the direct supervision of an experienced 
and responsible person specifically designated for this duty by the person in 
charge of the loading or unloading of the vessel.

(5) Refueling may not be undertaken with less than two persons specifically 
assigned and present for the complete operation, at least one of whom must be 
experienced in using the portable fire extinguishers required in the fuel area.

(6) At least one Coast Guard approved marine type size 1 Type B or UL approved 
5BC portable fire extinguisher or its approved equivalent, must be provided in 
the fueling area. This is in addition to the extinguisher required by paragraph 
(g)(8) of this section.

(7) The location for refueling trucks must be designated by the master or senior 
deck officer on board the vessel. “NO SMOKING” signs must be conspicuously 
posted in the area.

(8) The location designated for refueling must be adequately ventilated to 
insure against accumulation of any hazardous concentration of vapors.

(9) Before any truck in a hold is refueled or before any fuel handling device or 
unmounted liquefied petroleum gas cylinder is placed in a hold, the motors of 
all trucks in the same hold must be stopped.

(10) All fuel handling devices and unmounted liquefied petroleum gas containers 
must be removed from a hold before any truck motor is started and the trucks are 
placed in operation in that hold.

(i) 
Replacing batteries.
Batteries for electrically powered trucks and for the ignition systems of 
internal combustion powered trucks may be changed in the hold of a vessel 
subject to the following conditions:

(1) Only suitable handling equipment may be employed.

(2) Adequate precautions must be taken to avoid damage to the battery, short 
circuiting of the battery, and spillage of the electrolyte.

(j) 
Charging of batteries.
Batteries of industrial trucks may be recharged in a hold of a vessel subject to 
the following conditions:
(1) The batteries must be housed in a suitable, ventilated, portable metal 
container with a suitable outlet at the top for connection of a portable air 
hose, or must be placed directly beneath a suitable outlet at the top for 
connection of a portable air hose. The air hose must be permanently connected to 
an exhaust duct leading to the open deck and terminate in a gooseneck or other 
suitable weather head. If natural ventilation is not practicable or adequate, 
mechanical means of exhaust must be employed in conjunction with the duct. The 
air outlet on the battery container must be equipped with an interlock switch so 
arranged that the charging of the battery cannot take place unless the air hose 
is properly connected to the box.

(2) If mechanical ventilation is used, an additional interlock must be provided 
between the fan and the charging circuit so that the fan must be in operation in 
order to complete the charging circuit for operation. It is preferable that this 
interlock switch be of a centrifugal type driven by the fan shaft.

(3) The hold may not contain any hazardous materials.

(4) The charging facilities may be part of the truck equipment or may be 
separate from the truck and located inside or outside the cargo hold. The power 
supply or charging circuit (whichever method is used) must be connected to the 
truck by a portable plug connection of the break-away type. This portable plug 
must be so engaged with the truck battery charging outlet that any movement of 
the truck away from the charging station will break the connection between the 
plug and receptacle without exposing any live parts to contact with a conducting 
surface or object and without the plug falling to the deck where it may become 
subject to damage.

(5) All unmounted batteries must be suitably protected or removed from an area 
in the hold of the vessel before any truck is operated in that area.

(k) 
Stowage of power-operated industrial trucks on board a vessel.
Trucks stowed on board a vessel must meet vessel stowage requirements in 
§ 176.905.
(l) 
Packaging and stowage of fuel on board a vessel.

Subpart D—General Segregation Requirements


§ 176.80

Applicability.

(a) This subpart sets forth segregation requirements in addition to any 
segregation requirements set forth elsewhere in this subchapter.

(b) Hazardous materials in limited quantities when loaded in transport vehicles 
and freight containers, are excepted from the segregation requirements of this 
subpart and any additional segregation specified in this subchapter for 
transportation by vessel; except that articles of division 1.4, compatibility 
group S, shall not be stowed in the same compartment or hold, or cargo transport 
unit with hazardous materials of Class 1 of compatibility groups A and L.

[Amdt. 176-1, 41 FR 16110, Apr. 15, 1976, as amended by Amdt. 176-3, 42 FR 
57967, Nov. 7, 1977; 80 FR 1164, Jan. 8, 2015]


§ 176.83

Segregation.

(a) 
General.
(1) The requirements of this section apply to all cargo spaces on deck or under 
deck of all types of vessels, and to all cargo transport units.
(2) Segregation is obtained by maintaining certain distances between 
incompatible hazardous materials or by requiring the presence of one or more 
steel bulkheads or decks between them 
or a combination thereof. Intervening spaces between such hazardous materials 
may be filled with other cargo which is not incompatible with the hazardous 
materials.
(3) The general requirements for segregation between the various classes of 
dangerous goods are shown in the segregation table. In addition to these general 
requirements, there may be a need to segregate a particular material from other 
materials which would contribute to its hazard. Such segregation requirements 
are indicated by code numbers in Column 10B of the § 172.101 Table.

(4) Segregation is not required:

(i) Between hazardous materials of different classes which comprise the same 
substance but vary only in their water content (for example, sodium sulfide in 
Division 4.2 or Class 8) or quantity for Class 7 materials; or

(ii) Between hazardous materials of different classes which comprise a group of 
substances that do not react dangerously with each other. The following 
materials are grouped by compatibility:

(A) Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions 
with not less than 8 percent but less than 20 percent hydrogen peroxide 
(stabilized as necessary)
; Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions 
with not less than 20 percent but not more than 40 percent hydrogen peroxide;
Hydrogen peroxide, aqueous solutions 
with more than 40 percent but not more than 60 percent hydrogen peroxide;
Hydrogen peroxide and peroxyacetic acid mixtures, stabilized 
with acids, water and not more than 5 percent peroxyacetic acid;
Organic peroxide type D, liquid; Organic peroxide type E, liquid; Organic 
peroxide type F, liquid; and
(B) Dichlorosilane, Silicon tetrachloride, and Trichlorosilane.

(5) Whenever hazardous materials are stowed together, whether or not in a cargo 
transport unit, the segregation of such hazardous materials from others must 
always be in accordance with the most restrictive requirements for any of the 
hazardous materials concerned.

(6) When the § 172.101 Table or § 172.402 requires packages to bear a subsidiary 
hazard label or labels, the segregation appropriate to the subsidiary hazards 
must be applied when that segregation is more restrictive than that required by 
the primary hazard. For the purposes of this paragraph, the segregation 
requirements corresponding to an explosive subsidiary hazard are—except for 
organic peroxides which are those corresponding to Division 1.3—those for 
Division 1.4 (explosive) materials.

(7) Where, for the purposes of segregation, terms such as “away from” a 
particular hazard class are used in the § 172.101 Table, the segregation 
requirement applies to:

(i) All hazardous materials within the hazard class; and

(ii) All hazardous materials for which a secondary hazard label of that class is 
required.

(8) Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a)(6) and (a)(7) of this 
section, hazardous materials of the same class may be stowed together without 
regard to segregation required by secondary hazards (subsidiary risk label(s)), 
provided the substances do not react dangerously with each other and cause:

(i) Combustion and/or evolution of considerable heat;

(ii) Evolution of flammable, toxic or asphyxiant gases;

(iii) The formation of corrosive substances; or

(iv) The formation of unstable substances.

(9) Stowage in a shelter-'tween deck cargo space is not considered to be “on 
deck” stowage.

(10) Where the code in column (10B) of the § 172.101 Table specifies that 
“Segregation as for. . .” applies, the segregation requirements applicable to 
that class in the § 176.83(b) General Segregation Table must be applied. 
However, for the purposes of paragraph (a)(8) of this section, which permits 
substances of the same class to be stowed together provided they do not react 
dangerously with each other, the segregation requirements of the class as 
represented by the primary hazard class in the § 172.101 Table entry must be 
applied.

(11) Certain exceptions from segregation for waste cyanides or waste cyanide 
mixtures or solutions transported with acids; waste Division 4.2 materials 
transported with Class 8 liquids; and 
waste Division 6.1 Packing Group I, Hazard Zone A material transported with 
waste Class 3 material, Class 8 liquids, and Division 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1 or 5.2 
material are set forth in § 173.12(e) of this subchapter.
(b) 
General Segregation Table.
The following table sets forth the general requirements for segregation between 
the various classes (divisions) of hazardous materials. Certain divisions are 
listed as separate hazard classes for the purpose of this table (
e.g.
, “2.1” and “2.2”). The properties of materials within each class may vary 
greatly and may require greater segregation than is reflected in this table. If 
the § 172.101 Table sets forth particular requirements for segregation, they 
take precedence over these general requirements.

from.”

X—The segregation, if any, is shown in the § 172.101 table.

*—See § 176.144 of this part for segregation within Class 1.


(c) 
Segregation requirements for breakbulk cargo.
(1) The requirements of this paragraph apply to the segregation of packages 
containing hazardous materials and stowed as breakbulk cargo;
(2) Definition of the segregation terms:

(i) Legend:

(A) Package containing incompatible goods.


EC02MR91.070

(B) Reference package.


EC02MR91.071

(C) Deck resistant to fire and liquid.


EC02MR91.072


Note:

Full vertical lines represent transverse bulkheads between compartments or holds 
resistant to fire and liquid.

(ii) 
“Away from”:
Effectively segregated so that the incompatible materials cannot interact 
dangerously in the event of an accident but may be carried in the same 
compartment or hold or on deck provided a minimum horizontal separation of 3 m 
(10 feet) projected vertically is obtained.

EC02MR91.073

(iii) 
“Separated From”:
In different compartments or holds when stowed under deck. If the intervening 
deck is resistant to fire and liquid, a vertical separation (i.e., in different 
compartments) is acceptable as equivalent to this segregation. For “on deck” 
stowage, this segregation means a separation by a distance of at least 6 m (20 
feet) horizontally.

EC02MR91.091

(iv) “
Separated by a complete compartment or hold from
”: Either a vertical or horizontal separation. If the intervening decks are not 
resistant to fire and liquid, then only a longitudinal separation (i.e., by an 
intervening complete compartment or hold) is acceptable. For “on deck” stowage, 
this segregation means a separation by a distance of at least 12 m (39 feet) 
horizontally. The same distance must be applied if one package is stowed “on 
deck”, and the other one in an upper compartment.


EC02MR91.074


Note:

One of the two decks must be resistant to fire and liquid.

(v) “
Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete compartment or hold from
”: Vertical separation alone does not meet this requirement. Between a package 
“under deck” and one “on deck” a minimum distance of 24 m (79 feet) including a 
complete compartment must be maintained longitudinally. For “on deck” stowage, 
this segregation means a separation by a distance of at least 24 m (79 feet) 
longitudinally.

EC02MR91.075

(d) 
Segregation in cargo transport units:
Two hazardous materials for which any segregation is required may not be stowed 
in the same cargo transport unit.
(e) 
Segregation of hazardous materials stowed as breakbulk cargo from those packed 
in cargo transport units:
(1) Hazardous materials stowed as breakbulk cargo must be segregated from 
materials packed in open cargo transport units in accordance with paragraph (c) 
of this section.
(2) Hazardous materials stowed as breakbulk cargo must be segregated from 
materials packed in closed cargo transport units in accordance with paragraph 
(c) of this section, except that:

(i) Where “away from” is required, no segregation between packages and the 
closed cargo transport units is required; and

(ii) Where “separated from” is required, the segregation between the packages 
and the closed cargo transport units may be the same as for “away from”.

(f) 
Segregation of cargo transport units on board container vessels:
(1) Except for hatchless container ships, this paragraph applies to segregation 
of cargo transport units that are carried on board container vessels, or on 
other types of vessels, provided these cargo spaces are properly fitted for 
permanent stowage of containers during transport.
(2) For container vessels which have cargo spaces used for breakbulk cargo or 
any other method of stowage, the appropriate paragraph of this section applies 
to the relevant cargo space.

(3) 
Segregation Table.
Table § 176.83(f) sets forth the general requirements for segregation between 
cargo transport units on board container vessels.
(4) In table § 176.83(f), a 
container space
means a distance of not less than 6 m (20 feet) fore and aft or not less than 
2.5 m (8 feet) athwartship.

(h) 
Segregation on board barge carrying vessels:
(1) The requirements of this section apply to the segregation in shipborne 
barges as well as to the segregation between shipborne barges carried on board 
vessels specially designed and equipped to carry such barges.
(2) On barge-carrying vessels which incorporate other stowage spaces or any 
other method of stowage, barges containing hazardous materials must be 
segregated from hazardous materials not stowed in barges as prescribed in 
paragraphs (b) and (j) of this section.

(i) 
Segregation in shipborne barges:
Hazardous materials transported in shipborne barges must be segregated as 
prescribed in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.
(j) 
Segregation between shipborne barges on barge-carrying vessels:
(1) When a shipborne barge is loaded with two or more hazardous materials with 
different requirements for segregation, the most stringent applicable 
segregation requirement must be applied.
(2) “Away from” and “separated from” require no segregation between shipborne 
barges.

(3) For barge-carrying vessels with vertical holds, “Separated by a complete 
compartment or hold from” means that separate holds are required. On 
barge-carrying vessels having horizontal barge levels, separate barge levels are 
required and the barges may not be in the same vertical line.

(4) “Separated longitudinally by an intervening complete compartment or hold 
from” means, for barge-carrying vessels with vertical holds, that separation by 
an intervening hold or engine room is required. On barge-carrying vessels having 
horizontal barge levels, separate barge levels and a longitudinal separation by 
at least two intervening barge spaces are required.

(k) 
Segregation requirements for ferry vessels:
A ferry vessel (when operating either as a passenger or cargo vessel) that 
cannot provide the separation required in this section may carry incompatible 
hazardous materials in separate transport vehicles if they are stowed to give 
the maximum possible separation.
(l) 
Segregation of containers on board hatchless (open-top) container ships:
(1) This paragraph applies to the segregation of cargo transport units that are 
transported on board hatchless container ships provided that the cargo spaces 
are properly fitted to give permanent stowage of the cargo transport units 
during transport.
(2) For container ships that have both hatchless container spaces and other 
spaces suitable for breakbulk cargo, conventional container stowage, or any 
other method of stowage, the appropriate requirements of this section apply to 
the relevant cargo space.

(3) 
Segregation Table.
Table § 176.83(l)(3) sets forth the general requirements for segregation of 
cargo transport units on board hatchless container ships.
(4) In Table § 176.83(l)(3), a container space means a distance of not less than 
6 m (20 feet) fore and aft or not less than 2.5 m (8 feet) athwartship.

(m) 
Provisions for segregation groups:
(1) For the purpose of segregation, materials having certain similar chemical 
properties have been grouped together in segregation groups. The segregation 
groups (such as “acids”, “chlorates”, “permanganates”) and the entries allocated 
to each of these groups include the substances identified in section 3.1.4 of 
the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter). When column (10B) of the 
§ 172.101 Table refers to a numbered stowage provision set forth in § 176.84(b) 
such as “Stow ‘away from’ acids”, that particular stowage/segregation 
requirement applies to all the materials allocated to the respective segregation 
group.
(2) Not all hazardous materials falling within a segregation group are listed by 
name in the regulations. These materials are shipped under “n.o.s.” entries. 
Although these “n.o.s.” entries are not listed themselves in the above groups, 
the person who offers a hazardous material for transportation must decide 
whether allocation under a segregation group is appropriate.

(3) The segregation groups described above do not address materials that fall 
outside the classification criteria of the hazardous materials regulations, 
although it is recognized that some non-hazardous materials have certain 
chemical properties similar to hazardous materials listed in the segregation 
groups. A person who offers a hazardous material for transportation or the 
person responsible for packing the materials into a cargo transport unit who 
does have knowledge of the chemical properties of such non-hazardous materials 
may identify a relevant segregation group and apply the segregation requirements 
for that segregation group.

(a) 
General.
When Column 10B of the § 172.101 Table refers to a numbered or alpha-numeric 
stowage provision for water shipments, the meaning and requirements of that 
provision are set forth in this section. Terms in quotation marks are defined in 
§ 176.83. Other terms used in the table in this section such as “acids”, 
“chlorates” and “permanganates” indicate different chemical groups referred to 
here as segregation groups. Materials falling within a segregation group are 
considered to have certain similar chemical properties and, although not 
exhaustive in nature, the materials belonging to each group include those 
substances identified in section 3.1.4 of the IMDG Code (IBR, see § 171.7 of 
this subchapter) as set forth in § 176.83(m).

(2) Motor vehicles may be stowed in the same hold or compartment or on the 
vehicle deck of passenger vessels with cylinders of liquefied petroleum gas when 
the cylinders are securely attached to recreational vehicles, such as campers or 
trailers.

(3) Extra containers of gasoline (including camp stove or lantern fuel) and 
portable cylinders of liquefied petroleum gas (including cylinders for camping 
equipment) not securely attached to recreational vehicles must be stowed in the 
vessel's paint locker. Containers must be securely closed.

(4) All liquefied petroleum gas cylinders must be secured by closing the 
shut-off valves prior to the recreational vehicles being loaded on the vessels. 
The owner or operator of each recreational vehicle must be directed to close all 
operating valves within the vehicles.

(5) “No smoking” signs must be posted on the vehicle decks and, if used for 
storage of hazardous materials; in close proximity to the vessel's paint locker.

(6) An hourly patrol of the vehicle decks must be made by a crewmember. Any 
unusual or dangerous situation must be reported to the vessel's master.

(7) Passengers may be allowed on the vehicle decks during the voyage and are 
subject to the control of the crew personnel conducting the continuous vehicle 
deck patrol.

(8) Each person responsible for performing a function authorized by this section 
must be trained in accordance with subpart H of part 172 of this subchapter and 
on the requirements of this section.

§ 176.93

Vehicles having refrigerating or heating equipment.

(a) A transport vehicle fitted with refrigerating or heating equipment using a 
flammable liquid or Division 2.1 (flammable gas) material, or diesel oil as 
fuel, may be transported on a ferry vessel. However, the refrigerating or 
heating equipment may not be operated while the vehicle is on the vessel, unless 
the equipment complies with the following requirements:

(1) The installation is rigidly mounted and free of any motion other than normal 
vibration in operation;

(2) An easily accessible shutoff control is fitted to the fuel and electrical 
supply of the refrigerating or heating equipment; and

(3) The fuel storage tank, the fuel lines, the carburetor and any other fuel 
devices are tight and show no signs of leakage.

(b) If the vehicle operator desires to operate the refrigerating or heating 
equipment while on the vessel and the equipment is not fitted with automatic 
starting and stopping devices, it must be started before the vehicle is taken on 
board. It may continue in operation while the vehicle is on the vessel, but if 
the motor stops it may not be restarted.

(c) In the case of a ferry vessel on a voyage exceeding 30 minutes' duration, 
stowage must be provided for transport vehicles having refrigerating or heating 
equipment operated by internal combustion engines which will permit ready 
diffusion of exhaust gases to the 
open air. Passenger vehicles may not be stowed in a position adjacent to 
vehicles operating internal combustion motors which expose the occupants of the

§ 176.116

General stowage conditions for Class 1 (explosive) materials.

(a) 
Stowage Location:
(1) Class 1 (explosive) materials must be stowed in a cool part of the ship and 
must be kept as cool as practicable while on board. Class 1 (explosives) must be 
stowed as far away as practicable from any potential source of heat or ignition.
(2) With the exception of division 1.4 (explosive) materials, Class 1 
(explosive) materials may not be positioned closer to the ship's side than a 
distance equal to one eighth of the beam or 2.4 m (8 feet), whichever is less.

(3) Except where the consignment of Class 1 (explosive) materials consists only 
of explosive articles, the wearing of shoes or boots with unprotected metal 
nails, heels, or tips of any kind is prohibited.

(b) 
Wetness:
(1) Spaces where Class 1 (explosive) materials are stowed below deck must be 
dry. In the event of the contents of packages being affected by water when on 
board immediate advice must be sought from the shippers; pending this advice 
handling of the packages must be avoided.
(2) Bilges and bilge sections must be examined and any residue of previous cargo 
removed before Class 1 materials (explosive) are loaded onto the vessel.

(c) 
Security:
All compartments, magazines, and cargo transport units containing Class 1 
(explosive) materials must be locked or suitably secured in order to prevent 
unauthorized access.
(d) 
Secure stowage:
Class 1 (explosive) materials must be securely stowed to prevent shifting in 
transit; where necessary, precautions must be taken to prevent cargo sliding 
down between the frames at the ship's sides.
(e) 
Separation from accommodation spaces and machinery spaces:
(1) Class 1 (explosive) materials must be stowed as far away as practicable from 
any accommodation spaces or any machinery space and may not be stowed directly 
above or below such a space. The requirements in paragraphs (e)(2) through 
(e)(4) of this section are minimum requirements in addition to the 
applicable requirements of 46 CFR chapter I. Where the requirements of this 
subpart are less stringent than those of 46 CFR chapter I, the 46 CFR chapter I 
requirements must be satisfied for ships to which they are applicable.
(2) There must be a permanent A Class steel bulkhead between any accommodation 
space and any compartment containing Class 1 (explosive) materials. Division 
1.1, 1.2, 1.3, or 1.5 materials may not be stowed within 3 m (10 feet) of this 
bulkhead; in the decks immediately above or below an accommodation space they 
must be stowed at least 3 m (10 feet) from the line of this bulkhead projected 
vertically.

(3) There must be a permanent A Class steel bulkhead between a compartment 
containing Class 1 (explosive) materials and any machinery space. Class 1 
(explosive) materials, except those in Division 1.4 (explosive), may not be 
stowed within 3 m (10 feet) of this bulkhead; and in the decks above or below 
the machinery space they must be stowed at least 3 m (10 feet) from the line of 
this bulkhead projected vertically. In addition to this separation, there must 
be insulation to Class A60 standard as defined in 46 CFR 72.05-10(c)(1) if the 
machinery space is one of Category ‘A’ unless the only Class 1 (explosive) 
materials carried are in Division 1.4S (explosive).

(4) Where Class 1 (explosive) materials are stowed away from bulkheads bounding 
any accommodation space or machinery space, the intervening space may be filled 
with cargo that is not readily combustible.

Notes:
1. Explosive articles in compatibility group G, other than fireworks, may be 
stowed with articles of compatibility groups C, D, and E, provided no explosive 
substances are carried in the same compartment, magazine or cargo transport 
unit.
2. Explosives in compatibility group L may only be stowed in the same 
compartment, magazine or cargo transport unit with identical explosives within 
compatibility group L.

3. Different types of articles of Division 1.6, compatibility group N, may only 
be transported together when it is proven that there is no additional risk of 
sympathetic detonation between the articles. Otherwise they must be treated as 
division 1.1.

4. When articles of compatibility group N are transported with articles or 
substances of compatibility groups C, D or E, the goods of compatibility group N 
must be treated as compatibility group D.

5. When articles of compatibility group N are transported together with articles 
or substances of compatibility group S, the entire load must be treated as 
compatibility group N.

6. Any combination of articles in compatibility groups C, D and E must be 
treated as compatibility group E. Any combination of substances in compatibility 
groups C and D must be treated as the most appropriate compatibility group shown 
in Table 2 of § 173.52 taking into account the predominant characteristics of 
the combined load. This overall classification code must be displayed on any 
label or placard on a unit load or cargo transport unit as prescribed in subpart 
E (Labeling) and subpart F (Placarding).

(b) Where Class 1 (explosive) materials of different compatibility groups are 
allowed to be stowed in the same compartment, magazine, or cargo transport unit, 
the stowage arrangements must conform to the most stringent requirements for the 
entire load.

(c) Where a mixed load of Class 1 (explosive) materials of different hazard 
divisions and/or stowage arrangements is carried within a compartment, magazine, 
or cargo transport unit, the entire load must be treated as belonging to the 
hazard division having the greatest hazard. (For example, if a load of Division 
1.1 (explosive) materials is mixed with Division 1.3 (explosive) materials, the 
load is treated as a Division 1.1 (explosive) material as defined in § 173.50(b) 
of this subchapter and the stowage must conform to the most stringent 
requirements for the entire load).

(d) If some of the Class 1 (explosive) materials in a stowage mixture require

(explosive) materials, it must be visually examined by the shipper to ensure it 
is structurally serviceable, free of any residue of previous cargo, and its 
interior walls and floors are free from protrusions.

(2) 
Structurally serviceable
means the freight container or the vehicle cannot have major defects in its 
structural components, such as top and bottom side rails, top and bottom end 
rails, door sill and header, floor cross members, corner posts, and corner 
fittings in a freight container. Major defects include—
(i) Dents or bends in the structural members greater than 19 mm (0.75 inch) in 
depth, regardless of length;

(ii) Cracks or breaks in structural members;

(iii) More than one splice or an improper splice (such as a lapped splice) in 
top or bottom end rails or door headers;

(iv) More than two splices in any one top or bottom side rail;

(v) Any splice in a door sill or corner post;

(vi) Door hinges and hardware that are seized, twisted, broken, missing, or 
otherwise inoperative;

(vii) Gaskets and seals that do not seal; or

(viii) For freight containers, any distortion of the overall configuration great 
enough to prevent proper alignment of handling equipment, mounting and securing 
chassis or vehicle, or insertion into ships' cells.

(3) In addition, deterioration of any component of the freight container or 
vehicle, regardless of the material of construction, such as rusted-out metal in 
sidewalls or disintegrated fiberglass, 
is prohibited. Normal wear, however, including oxidation (rust), slight dents 
and scratches, and other damage that does not affect serviceability or the 
weather-tight integrity of the units, is not prohibited.

Permit requirements for Division 1.5, ammonium nitrates, and certain ammonium 
nitrate fertilizers.

(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, before any of the 
following material is loaded on or unloaded from a vessel at any waterfront 
facility, the owner/operator must obtain written permission from the Captain of 
the Port (COTP).
(1) Ammonium nitrate UN1942, ammonium nitrate fertilizers containing more than 
70% ammonium nitrate, or Division 1.5 compatibility group D materials packaged 
in a paper bag, burlap bag, or other nonrigid combustible packaging, or any 
rigid packaging with combustible inside packagings,

(2) Any other ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrate fertilizer not listed in 
§ 176.410(a) or (b).

(b) Any of the following may be loaded on or unloaded from a vessel at any 
waterfront facility without a permit:

(1) Ammonium nitrate, Division 5.1 (oxidizer) UN1942, in a rigid packaging with 
a noncombustible inside packaging.

(2) Ammonium nitrate fertilizer, Division 5.1 (oxidizer) UN 2067, if the nearest 
COTP is notified at least 24 hours in advance of any loading or unloading in

§ 176.708

Segregation distances.

(a) Table IV lists minimum separation distances between radioactive materials 
and spaces regularly occupied by crew members or passengers, or between 
radioactive materials and undeveloped photographic film. It expresses the 
separation distances as a function of the sum of the TIs of all packages in a 
single consignment, in the case of 0 or 3 feet of intervening cargo of unit 
density for persons, and 0, 3, or 6 feet of intervening cargo of unit density 
for undeveloped film. Cargo of unit density is stowed cargo with a density of 1 
long ton (2240 lbs.) per 36 cubic feet. Separation distances may be interpolated 
from the table where appropriate.

(b) Table IV is to be used to determine the separation distance for undeveloped 
film.

(c) Category YELLOW-II or YELLOW-III packages or overpacks must not be 
transported in spaces occupied by passengers, except those exclusively reserved 
for couriers specially authorized to accompany such packages or overpacks.

(d) The separation distances for crew members and passengers may be determined 
by one of two methods:

(1) By using Table IV to determine the minimum distances between the radioactive 
material packages and regularly occupied spaces or living quarters; or

(2) For one or more consignments of Class 7 (radioactive) material to be loaded 
on board a vessel under the exclusive use conditions described in § 176.704(f), 
by demonstration through direct measurement, made and documented by a suitably 
qualified person, that for the indicated exposure times the dose rate in 
regularly occupied spaces or living quarters is less than—

(i) For the crew: 7.0 µSv/h (0.70 mrem/h) up to 700 hours in a year, or 1.8 
µSv/h (0.18 mrem/h) up to 2750 hours in a year; and

(ii) For the passengers: 1.8 µSv/h (0.18 mrem/h) up to 550 hours in a year, 
taking into account any relocation of cargo during the voyage.

(e) Any departure from the segregation provisions should be approved by the 
competent authority of the flag state of the ship and, when requested, by the 
competent authority at each port of call.

Care following leakage or sifting of radioactive materials.

(a) In case of fire, collision, or breakage involving any shipment of 
radioactive materials, other than materials of low specific activity, the 
radioactive materials must be segregated from unnecessary contact with 
personnel. In case of obvious leakage, or if the inside container appears to be 
damaged, the stowage area (hold, compartment, or deck area) containing this 
cargo must be isolated as much as possible to prevent radioactive material from 
entering any person's body through contact, inhalation, or ingestion. No person 
may handle the material or remain in the vicinity unless supervised by a 
qualified person.

(b) A hold or compartment in which leakage of radioactive materials has occurred 
may not be used for other cargo until it is decontaminated in accordance with 
the requirements of § 176.715.

(c) For reporting requirements, see § 171.15 of this subchapter.


§ 176.715

activity or surface contaminated object Class 7 (radioactive) materials under 
exclusive use conditions in accordance with § 173.427(b)(4), or § 173.427(c) 
must be surveyed with appropriate radiation detection instruments after each 
use. Such holds, compartments, and deck areas may not be used again for Class 7 
(radioactive) materials exclusive use transport service, and then only for a 
subsequent exclusive use shipment utilizing the provisions of § 173.427(b)(4), 
or § 173.427(c) until the radiation dose rate at every accessible surface is 
less than 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h), and the non-fixed contamination is not 
greater than the limits prescribed in § 173.443(a) of this subchapter.

General stowage requirements.

(a) Each package required to have a Class 8 (corrosive) label thereon being 
transported on a vessel must be stowed clear of living quarters, and away from 
foodstuffs and cargo of an organic nature. For the purposes of this section, 
food ingredients intended for human consumption (ingredients) that are Class 8 
(corrosive) materials are not considered to be incompatible with other food 
ingredients if the intended use of those ingredients is for the manufacture of 
food, or food ingredients containing those food ingredients (or like 
ingredients), with or without other ingredients.

(b) A package of Class 8 (corrosive material) material may not be stowed over 
any readily combustible material.

(c) Glass carboys containing Class 8 (corrosive material) material may not be 
stowed on board any vessel, other than a barge, more than two tiers high unless 
each carboy is boxed or crated with neck protection extending to the sides of 
the carboy box. This protective construction must be strong enough to permit 
stacking one on top of the other.

(d) A Class 8 (corrosive material) material may not be stowed over a hold or 
compartment containing cotton unless the deck is of steel and the hatch is 
fitted with a tight coaming. In addition, the deck must be tight against leakage 
and the Class 8 (corrosive material) material may not be stowed over the square 
of the hatch.

(e) Each package of Class 8 (corrosive material) which also bears a FLAMMABLE

§ 176.805

On deck stowage.

When break bulk Class 8 (corrosive materials) materials being transported on a 
vessel are stowed on deck:

(a) Provisions must be made for leakage from any package to drain away from 
other cargo into an overboard scupper or freeing port. The drainage may not 
enter an enclosed drainage system other than a direct overboard scupper. If this 
stowage is not practical, sufficient clean dry sand must be placed under and 
around the lower tier of packages to absorb any leakage.

(b) Dunnage must be provided on the deck and arranged so that any leakage will 
be apparent.

(c) Any leakage that occurs must be washed down, using liberal quantities of 
water.

by the master. “NO SMOKING” signs must be conspicuously posted in appropriate 
places, and the responsible person in charge of the loading or unloading (see 
§ 176.57 of this part) must ensure that they are observed.

(i) Cotton or vegetable fibers may be stowed in the same hold over bulk sulfur 
if the sulfur has been trimmed and leveled and the hold is thoroughly cleaned of 
sulfur dust. A tight floor of two layers of 2.54 cm (1 inch) crossed clean 
dunnage boards must be laid on the sulfur before cotton or vegetable fibers are 
stowed. These substances may be stowed alongside each other in the same hold if 
they are separated by a tight dustproof wood bulkhead.

(j) Cotton or vegetable fibers may not be stowed in a 'tween deck hold over bulk 
sulfur in a lower hold unless the 'tween deck hold has been thoroughly cleaned 
of all sulfur dust and the 'tween deck hatch covers are in place and covered 
with tarpaulins and dunnage.

requirements of the IME Standard 22 (IBR, see § 171.7 of this subchapter).

(h) 
Lading within body or covered tailgate closed.
Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, dealing with the 
transportation of liquid nitroglycerin, desensitized liquid nitroglycerin or 
diethylene glycol dinitrate, all of that portion of the lading of any motor 
vehicle which consists of Class 1 (explosive) materials shall be contained 
entirely within the body of the motor vehicle or within the horizontal outline 
thereof, without overhang or projection of any part of the load and if such 
motor vehicle has a tailboard or tailgate, it shall be closed and secured in 
place during such transportation. Every motor vehicle transporting Class 1 
(explosive) materials must either have a closed body or have the body thereof 
covered with a tarpaulin, and in either event care must be taken to protect the 
load from moisture and sparks, except that subject to other provisions of these 
regulations, Class 1 (explosive) materials other than black powder may be 
transported on flat-bed vehicles if the explosive portion of the load on each 
vehicle is packed in fire and water resistant containers or covered with a fire 
and water resistant tarpaulin.
(i) 
Class 1 (explosive) materials to be protected against damage by other lading.
No motor vehicle transporting any Class 1 (explosive) material may transport as 
a part of its load any metal or other articles or materials likely to damage 
such Class 1 (explosive) material or any package in which it is contained, 
unless the different parts of such load be so segregated or secured in place in 
or on the motor vehicle and separated by bulkheads or other suitable means as to 
prevent such damage.
(j) 
Transfer of Class 1 (explosive) materials en route.
No Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) material shall be transferred from one 
container to another, or from one motor vehicle to another vehicle, or from 
another vehicle to a motor vehicle, on any public highway, street, or road, 
except in case of emergency. In such cases red electric lanterns, red emergency 
reflectors or red flags shall be set out in the manner prescribed for disabled 
or stopped motor vehicles. (See Motor Carrier Safety Regulations, part 392 of 
this title.) In any event, all practicable means, in addition to these 
hereinbefore prescribed, shall be taken to protect and warn other users of the 
highway against the hazard involved in any such transfer or against the hazard 
occasioned by the emergency making such transfer necessary.
(k) 
Attendance of Class 1 (explosive) materials.
Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 materials that are stored during transportation in 
commerce must be attended and afforded surveillance in accordance with 49 CFR 
397.5. A safe haven that conforms to NFPA 498 (IBR, see § 171.7 of the 
subchapter) constitutes a federally approved safe haven for the unattended 
storage of vehicles containing Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 materials.

§ 177.837

Class 3 materials.

(See also § 177.834 (a) to (j).)

(a) 
Engine stopped.
Unless the engine of a cargo tank motor vehicle is to be used for the operation 
of a pump, Class 3 material may not be loaded into, or on, or unloaded from any 
cargo tank motor vehicle while the engine is running. The diesel engine of a 
cargo tank motor vehicle may be left running during the loading and unloading of 
a Class 3 material if the ambient atmospheric temperature is at or below −12 °C 
(10 °F).
(b) 
Bonding and grounding containers other than cargo tanks prior to and during 
transfer of lading.
For containers which are not in metallic contact with each other, either 
metallic bonds or ground conductors shall be provided for the neutralization of 
possible static charges prior to and during transfers of Class 3 (flammable 
liquid) materials between such containers. Such bonding shall be made by first 
connecting an electric conductor to the container to be filled and subsequently 
connecting the conductor to the container from which the liquid is to come, and 
not in any other order. To provide against ignition of vapors by discharge of 
static electricity, the latter connection shall be made at a point well removed 
from 
the opening from which the Class 3 (flammable liquid) material is to be 
discharged.
(c) 
Bonding and grounding cargo tanks before and during transfer of lading.
(1) When a cargo tank is loaded through an open filling hole, one end of a bond 
wire shall be connected to the stationary system piping or integrally connected 
steel framing, and the other end to the shell of the cargo tank to provide a 
continuous electrical connection. (If bonding is to the framing, it is essential 
that piping and framing be electrically interconnected.) This connection must be 
made before any filling hole is opened, and must remain in place until after the 
last filling hole has been closed. Additional bond wires are not needed around 
All-Metal flexible or swivel joints, but are required for nonmetallic flexible 
connections in the stationary system piping. When a cargo tank is unloaded by a 
suction-piping system through an open filling hole of the cargo tank, electrical 
continuity shall be maintained from cargo tank to receiving tank.
(2) When a cargo tank is loaded or unloaded through a vapor-tight (not open 
hole) top or bottom connection, so that there is no release of vapor at a point 
where a spark could occur, bonding or grounding is not required. Contact of the 
closed connection must be made before flow starts and must not be broken until 
after the flow is completed.

(3) Bonding or grounding is not required when a cargo tank is unloaded through a 
nonvapor-tight connection into a stationary tank provided the metallic filling 
connection is maintained in contact with the filling hole.

(d) 
Unloading combustible liquids.
For a cargo tank unloading a material meeting the definition for combustible 
liquid in § 173.150(f) of this subchapter, the qualified person attending the 
unloading operation must remain within 45.72 meters (150 feet) of the cargo tank 
and 7.62 meters (25 feet) of the delivery hose and must observe both the cargo 
tank and the receiving container at least once every five minutes during 
unloading operations that take more than five minutes to complete.

loading process and to keep them dry during transit. Special care shall also be 
taken in the loading of any motor vehicle with Class 4 (flammable solid) or 
Class 5 (oxidizing) materials, which are likely to become more hazardous to 
transport by wetting, to keep them from being wetted during the loading process 
and to keep them dry during transit. Examples of such dangerous materials are 
charcoal screenings, ground, crushed, or pulverized charcoal, and lump charcoal.
(c) 
Lading ventilation, precautions against spontaneous combustion.
Whenever a motor carrier has knowledge concerning the hazards of spontaneous 
combustion or heating of any article to be loaded on a motor vehicle, such 
article shall be so loaded as to afford sufficient ventilation of the load to 
provide 
reasonable assurance against fire from this cause; and in such a case the motor 
vehicle shall be unloaded as soon as practicable after reaching its destination. 
Charcoal screenings, or ground, crushed, granulated, or pulverized charcoal, in 
bags, shall be so loaded that the bags are laid horizontally in the motor 
vehicle, and so piled that there will be spaces for effective air circulation, 
which spaces shall not be less than 10 cm (3.9 inches) wide; and air spaces 
shall be maintained between rows of bags. Bags shall not be piled closer than 15

components of the discharge system, including delivery hose assemblies and 
piping, that are readily observed during the normal course of unloading to 
assure that they are of sound quality, without obvious defects detectable 
through visual observation and audio awareness, and that connections are secure. 
This check must be made after the pressure in the discharge system has reached 
at least equilibrium with the pressure in the cargo tank. Operators need not use 
instruments or take extraordinary actions to check components not readily 
visible. No operator may unload liquefied compressed gases from a cargo tank 
motor vehicle with a delivery hose assembly found to have any condition 
identified in § 180.416(g)(1) of this subchapter or with piping systems found to 
have any condition identified in § 180.416(g)(2) of this subchapter.

short periods when it is necessary to activate controls or monitor the receiving 
container.

(ii) For deliveries where the qualified person attending the unloading operation 
cannot maintain an unobstructed view of the cargo tank, when the internal 
self-closing stop valve is open, the qualified person must observe both the 
cargo tank and the receiving container at least once every five minutes during 
unloading operations that take more than five minutes to complete. In addition, 
by the compliance dates specified in §§ 173.315(n)(5) and 180.405(m)(3) of this 
subchapter, the cargo tank motor vehicle must have an emergency discharge 
control capability that meets the requirements of § 173.315(n)(2) or 
§ 173.315(n)(4) of this subchapter.

(q) 
Unloading procedures for liquefied petroleum gas and anhydrous ammonia in other 
than metered delivery service.
An operator must use the following procedures for unloading liquefied petroleum 
gas or anhydrous ammonia from a cargo tank motor vehicle in other than metered 
delivery service:

(1) The qualified person monitoring unloading must visually examine the facility 
hose assembly for obvious defects prior to its use in the unloading operation.

(2) The qualified person monitoring unloading must remain within arm's reach of 
the mechanical means of closure for the internal self-closing stop valve when 
the internal self-closing stop valve is open except for short periods when it is 
necessary to activate controls or monitor the receiving container. For chlorine 
cargo tank motor vehicles, the qualified person must remain within arm's reach 
of a means to stop the flow of product except for short periods when it is 
necessary to activate controls or monitor the receiving container.

(3) If the facility hose is equipped with a passive means to shut off the flow 
of product that conforms to and is maintained to the performance standard in 
§ 173.315(n)(2) of this subchapter, the qualified person may attend the 
unloading operation in accordance with the attendance requirements prescribed 
for the material being unloaded in § 177.834 of this section.

§ 177.842

Class 7 (radioactive) material.

(a) The number of packages of Class 7 (radioactive) materials in any transport 
vehicle or in any single group in any storage location must be limited so that 
the total transport index number does not exceed 50. The total transport index 
of a group of packages and overpacks is determined by adding together the 
transport index number on the labels on the individual packages and overpacks in 
the group. This provision does not apply to exclusive use shipments described in 
§§ 173.441(b), 173.457, and 173.427 of this subchapter.

(b) Packages of Class 7 (radioactive) material bearing “RADIOACTIVE YELLOW-II” 
or “RADIOACTIVE YELLOW-III” labels may not be placed in a transport vehicle, 
storage location or in any other place closer than the distances shown in the 
following table to any area which may be continuously occupied by any passenger, 
employee, or animal, nor closer than the distances shown in the table to any 
package containing undeveloped film (if so marked), and must conform to the 
following conditions:

(1) If more than one of these packages is present, the distance must be computed 
from the following table on the basis of the total transport index number 
determined by adding together the transport index number on the labels on the 
individual packages and overpacks in the vehicle or storeroom.

(2) Where more than one group of packages is present in any single storage 
location, a single group may not have a total transport index greater than 50. 
Each group of packages must be handled and stowed not closer than 6 m (20 feet) 
(measured edge to edge) to any other group. The following table is to be used in 
accordance with the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section:

Note:
The distance in this table must be measured from the nearest point on the 
nearest packages of Class 7 (radioactive) material.
(c) Shipments of low specific activity materials and surface contaminated 
objects, as defined in § 173.403 of this subchapter, must be loaded so as to 
avoid spillage and scattering of loose materials. Loading restrictions are set 
forth in § 173.427 of this subchapter.

(d) Packages must be so blocked and braced that they cannot change position 
during conditions normally incident to transportation.

(e) Persons should not remain unnecessarily in a vehicle containing Class 7 
(radioactive) materials.

(f) The number of packages of fissile Class 7 (radioactive) material in any 
non-exclusive use transport vehicle must be limited so that the sum of the 
criticality safety indices (CSIs) does not exceed 50. In loading and storage 
areas, fissile material packages must be grouped so that the sum of CSIs in any 
one group is not greater than 50; there may be more than one group of fissile 
material packages in a loading or storage area, so long as each group is at 
least 6 m (20 feet) away from all other such groups. All pertinent requirements 
of §§ 173.457 and 173.459 apply.

(g) For shipments transported under exclusive use conditions the radiation dose 
rate may not exceed 0.02 mSv per hour (2 mrem per hour) in any position normally 
occupied in the motor vehicle. For shipments transported as exclusive use under 
the provisions of § 173.441(b) of this subchapter for packages with external 
radiation levels in excess of 2 mSv (200 mrem per hour) at the package surface, 
the motor vehicle must meet the requirements of a closed transport vehicle (see 
§ 173.403 of this subchapter). The sum of criticality safety indices (CSIs) for 
packages containing fissile material may not exceed 100 in an exclusive use 
vehicle.

§ 177.843

Contamination of vehicles.

(a) Each motor vehicle used for transporting Class 7 (radioactive) materials 
under exclusive use conditions in accordance with § 173.427(b)(4), § 173.427(c), 
or § 173.443(b) of this subchapter must be surveyed with radiation detection 
instruments after each use. A vehicle may not be returned to Class 7 
(radioactive) materials exclusive use transport service, and then only for a 
subsequent exclusive use shipment utilizing the provisions of any of the 
paragraphs § 173.427(b)(4), § 173.427(c), or § 173.443(b), until the radiation 
dose rate at every accessible surface is 0.005 mSv/h (0.5 mrem/h) or less and 
the non-fixed contamination is not greater than the level prescribed in 
§ 173.443(a) of this subchapter.

(b) This section does not apply to any vehicle used solely for transporting 
Class 7 (radioactive) material if a survey of the interior surface shows that 
the radiation dose rate does not exceed 0.1 mSv per hour (10 mrem per hour) at 
the interior surface or 0.02 mSv per hour (2 mrem per hour) at 1 meter (3.3 
feet) from any interior surface. These vehicles must be stenciled with the words 
“For Radioactive Materials Use Only” in lettering at least 7.6 cm (3 inches) 
high in a conspicuous place, on both sides of the exterior of the vehicle. These 
vehicles must be kept closed at all times other than loading and unloading.

(c) In case of fire, accident, breakage, or unusual delay involving shipments of 
Class 7 (radioactive) material, see 
§§ 171.15, 171.16 and 177.854 of this subchapter.
(d) Each transport vehicle used to transport Division 6.2 materials must be 
disinfected prior to reuse if a Division 6.2 material is released from its 
packaging during transportation. Disinfection may be by any means effective for 
neutralizing the material released.

(e) lnstructions for using the segregation table for hazardous materials are as 
follows:

(1) The absence of any hazard class or division or a blank space in the table 
indicates that no restrictions apply.

(2) The letter “X” in the table indicates that these materials may not be 
loaded, transported, or stored together in the same transport vehicle or storage 
facility during the course of transportation.

(3) The letter “O” in the table indicates that these materials may not be 
loaded, transported, or stored together in the same transport vehicle or storage 
facility during the course of transportation unless separated in a manner that, 
in the event of leakage from packages under conditions normally incident to 
transportation, commingling of hazardous materials would not occur. 
Notwithstanding the methods of separation employed, Class 8 (corrosive) liquids 
may not be loaded above or adjacent to Class 4 (flammable) or Class 5 
(oxidizing) materials; except that shippers may load truckload shipments of such 
materials together when it is known that the mixture of contents would not cause 
a fire or a dangerous evolution of heat or gas.

(4) The “*” in the table indicates that segregation among different Class 1 
(explosive) materials is governed by the compatibility table in paragraph (f) of 
this section.

(5) The note “A” in the second column of the table means that, notwithstanding 
the requirements of the letter “X”, ammonium nitrate (UN1942) and ammonium 
nitrate fertilizer may be loaded or stored with Division 1.1 (explosive) or 
Division 1.5 materials, unless otherwise prohibited by § 177.835(c).

(6) When the § 172.101 table or § 172.402 of this subchapter requires a package 
to bear a subsidiary hazard label, segregation appropriate to the subsidiary 
hazard must be applied when that segregation is more restrictive than that 
required by the primary hazard. However, hazardous materials of the same class 
may be stowed together without regard to segregation required for any secondary 
hazard if the materials are not capable of reacting dangerously with each other 
and causing combustion or dangerous evolution of heat, evolution of flammable, 
poisonous, or asphyxiant gases, or formation of corrosive or unstable materials.

(f) Class 1 (explosive) materials shall not be loaded, transported, or stored 
together, except as provided in this section, and in accordance with the 
following table:

(g) Instructions for using the compatibility table for Class 1 (explosive) 
materials are as follows:

(1) A blank space in the table indicates that no restrictions apply.

(2) The letter “X” in the table indicates that explosives of different 
compatibility groups may not be carried on the same transport vehicle.

(3) The numbers in the table mean the following:

(i) “1” means an explosive from compatibility group L shall only be carried on 
the same transport vehicle with an identical explosive.

(ii) “2” means any combination of explosives from compatibility groups C, 
D, or E is assigned to compatibility group E.
(iii) “3” means any combination of explosives from compatibility groups C, D, or 
E with those in compatibility group N is assigned to compatibility group D.

(iv) “4” means see § 177.835(g) when transporting detonators.

(v) “5” means Division 1.4S fireworks may not be loaded on the same transport 
vehicle with Division 1.1 or 1.2 (explosive) materials.

(vi) “6” means explosive articles in compatibility group G, other than fireworks 
and those requiring special handling, may be loaded, transported and stored with 
other explosive articles of compatibility groups C, D and E, provided that 
explosive substances (such as those not contained in articles) are not carried 
in the same transport vehicle.

(h) Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, explosives of the same 
compatibility group but of different divisions may be transported together 
provided that the whole shipment is transported as though its entire contents 
were of the lower numerical division (i.e., Division 1.1 being lower than 
Division 1.2). For example, a mixed shipment of Division 1.2 (explosive) 
materials and Division 1.4 (explosive) materials, both of compatibility group D, 
must be transported as Division 1.2 (explosive) materials.

(i) When Division 1.5 materials, compatibility group D, are transported in the 
same freight container as Division 1.2 (explosive) materials, compatibility 
group D, the shipment must be transported as Division 1.1 (explosive) materials, 
compatibility group D.

Subpart D—Vehicles and Shipments in Transit; Accidents


§ 177.854

Disabled vehicles and broken or leaking packages; repairs.

(a) 
Care of lading, hazardous materials.
Whenever for any cause other than necessary traffic stops any motor vehicle 
transporting any hazardous material is stopped upon the traveled portion of any 
highway or shoulder thereof, special care shall be taken to guard the vehicle 
and its load or to take such steps as may be necessary to provide against 
hazard. Special effort shall be made to remove the motor vehicle to a place 
where the hazards of the materials being transported may be provided against. 
See §§ 392.22, 392.24, and 392.25 of this title for warning devices required to 
be displayed on the highway.
(b) 
Disposition of containers found broken or leaking in transit.
When leaks occur in packages or containers during the course of transportation, 
subsequent to initial loading, disposition of such package or container shall be 
made by the safest practical means afforded under paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) 
of this section.
(c) 
Repairing or overpacking packages.
(1) Packages may be repaired when safe and practicable, such repairing to be in 
accordance with the best and safest practice known and available.
(2) Packages of hazardous materials that are damaged or found leaking during 
transportation, and hazardous materials that have spilled or leaked during 
transportation, may be forwarded to destination or returned to the shipper in a 
salvage drum in accordance with the requirements of § 173.3(c) of this 
subchapter.

(d) 
Transportation of repaired packages.
Any package repaired in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(1) of 
this section may be transported to the nearest place at which it may safely be 
disposed of only in compliance with the following requirements:
(1) The package must be safe for transportation.

(2) The repair of the package must be adequate to prevent contamination of or 
hazardous admixture with other lading transported on the same motor vehicle 
therewith.

(3) If the carrier is not himself the shipper, the consignee's name and address 
must be plainly marked on the repaired package.

(e) 
Disposition of unsafe broken packages.
In the event any leaking package 
or container cannot be safely and adequately repaired for transportation or 
transported, it shall be stored pending proper disposition in the safest and 
most expeditious manner possible.
(f) 
Stopped vehicles; other dangerous articles.
Whenever any motor vehicle transporting Class 3 (flammable liquid), Class 4 
(flammable solid), Class 5 (oxidizing), Class 8 (corrosive), Class 2 (gases), or 
Division 6.1 (poisonous) materials, is stopped for any cause other than 
necessary traffic stops upon the traveled portion of any highway, or a shoulder 
next thereto, the following requirements shall be complied with during the 
period of such stop:
(1) For motor vehicles other than cargo tank motor vehicles used for the 
transportation of Class 3 (flammable liquid) or Division 2.1 (flammable gas) 
materials and not transporting Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials, 
warning devices must be set out in the manner prescribed in § 392.22 of this 
title.

(2) For cargo tanks used for the transportation of Class 3 (flammable liquid) or 
Division 2.1 (flammable gas) materials, whether loaded or empty, and vehicles 
transporting Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive) materials, warning devices 
must be set out in the manner prescribed by § 392.25 of this title.

(g)

—(1) 
General.
No person may use heat, flame or spark producing devices to repair or maintain 
the cargo or fuel containment system of a motor vehicle required to be 
placarded, other than COMBUSTIBLE, in accordance with subpart F of part 172 of 
this subchapter. As used in this section, “containment system” includes all 
vehicle components intended physically to contain cargo or fuel during loading 
or filling, transport, or unloading.
(2) 
Repair and maintenance inside a building.
No person may perform repair or maintenance on a motor vehicle subject to 
paragraph (g)(1) of this section inside a building unless:
(i) The motor vehicle's cargo and fuel containment systems are closed (except as 
necessary to maintain or repair the vehicle's motor) and do not show any 
indication of leakage;

(ii) A means is provided, and a person capable to operate the motor vehicle is 
available, to immediately remove the motor vehicle if necessary in an emergency;

(iii) The motor vehicle is removed from the enclosed area upon completion of 
repair or maintenance work; and

(iv) For motor vehicles loaded with Division 1.1, 1.2, or 1.3 (explosive), Class 
3 (flammable liquid), or Division 2.1 (flammable gas) materials, all sources of

Subpart E—Regulations Applying to Hazardous Material on Motor Vehicles Carrying 
Passengers for Hire


§ 177.870

Regulations for passenger carrying vehicles.

(a) 
Vehicles transporting passengers and property.
In addition to the regulations in parts 170-189 of this subchapter the following 
requirements shall apply to vehicles transporting passengers and property.
(b) 
No Class 1 (explosive) materials or other hazardous materials on 
passenger-carrying vehicles, exceptions.
No hazardous materials except small-arms 
ammunition, emergency shipments of drugs, chemicals and hospital supplies, and 
the accompanying munitions of war of the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air 
Force of the United States Government, are authorized by parts 170-189 of this 
subchapter to be transported on motor vehicles carrying passengers for hire 
where other practicable means of transportation is available.
(c) 
Class 1 (explosive) materials in passenger-carrying space forbidden.
No Class 1 (explosive) material, except small-arms ammunition, may be carried in 
the passenger-carrying space of any motor vehicle transporting passengers for 
hire.
(d) 
Hazardous materials on passenger carrying vehicles; quantity.
Where no other practicable means of transportation is available the following 
articles in the quantities as shown may be transported in motor vehicles 
carrying passengers for hire in a space other than that provided for passengers: 
Not to exceed 45 kg (99 pounds) gross weight of any or all of the kinds of Class 
1 (explosive) materials permitted to be transported by passenger-carrying 
aircraft or rail car may be transported on a motor vehicle transporting 
passengers: 
Provided, however,
That samples of Class 1 (explosive) materials for laboratory examination, not to 
exceed two samples, or a total of no more than 100 detonators, Division 1.4 
(explosive) materials at one time in a single motor vehicle, may be transported 
in a motor vehicle transporting passengers.
(e) 
Articles other than Class 1 (explosive) materials on passenger-carrying 
vehicles.
The gross weight of any given class of hazardous material other than Class 1 
(explosive) materials shall not exceed 45 kg (99 pounds), and the aggregate 
weight of all such other dangerous articles shall not exceed 225 kg (496 
pounds). This provision does not apply to nontoxic, nonflammable refrigerants, 
when such refrigerant is for servicing operations of a motor carrier on whose 
motor vehicles the refrigerant is used. A cylinder secured against shifting 
while in transit and not exceeding 113 kg (250 pounds) gross weight may be 
transported.
(f) 
Division 6.1 (poisonous) or Division 2.3 (poisonous gas) materials on 
passenger-carrying vehicles.
No motor carrier may transport any extremely dangerous Division 6.1 (poisonous) 
or Division 2.3 (poisonous gas) material, or any paranitroaniline, in any 
amount, in or on any bus while engaged in the transportation of passengers; or 
any less dangerous Division 6.1 (poisonous) material, which is other than a 
liquid, in any amount exceeding an aggregate of 45 kg (99 pounds) gross weight 
in or on any such bus.
(g) 
Class 7 (radioactive) materials.
In addition to the limitations prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (e) of this 
section, no person may transport any Class 7 (radioactive) material requiring 
labels under §§ 172.436, 172.438, and 172.440 of this subchapter in or on any 
motor vehicle carrying passengers for hire except where no other practicable 
means of transportation is available. Packages of Class 7 (radioactive) 
materials must be stored only in the trunk or baggage compartment of the 
vehicle, and must not be stored in any compartment occupied by persons. Packages 
of Class 7 (radioactive) materials must be handled and placed in the vehicle as
